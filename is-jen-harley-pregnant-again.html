"If they're happy, or if they are fighting in the public, or if she's dragging him in a car. I mean, I just want them to be good."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, is Jen pregnant again?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>This episode was filmed months again, and judging from Jen's most recent Instagram post, it's safe to say that she is not pregnant and it was just a false alarm.&nbsp;</p><p>Rocking a sexy black one-piece, Jen shows off her fit physique (and baby-bump free body) on the social media platform. Along with being mom to her daughter, Ariana, with Ron, Jen also has a 13-year-old son, Mason, from a previous relationship.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Ron and Jen still together?&nbsp;</h2><p>Despite their very public struggles, it seems <a href=#>the couple is still together</a> and in a much better place in 2019. This past Father's Day, Jen gushed about Ron and his parenting skills.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"Gym, tan, baby has been your ritual since Ariana has been born! You have been an amazing father since Day 1," she wrote. "You have always shared the load of getting up at night, changing diapers, bath time together, sick days, comforting her when she’s just not having a good day... We couldn’t ask for a better dad dad dad than you!"&nbsp;</p><p>And Ron made it very clear on the MTV series that he does not see himself having more kids with anyone else.&nbsp;</p><p>"I would rather have another child with Jen than have another child with another woman," he shared. "Why do I want to have three babys mom? It's like, let's have kids, get one babys mom, and then that's what it is [sic]." &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p><a href=#>Jenni "Jwoww" Farley,</a> however, has some very honest advice for the couple if they do decide to get pregnant again in the future.</p><p>"I feel like they need five years of therapy before another child," she said. "That's my opinion, I'm allowed to have it. This is America. But apparently, they are fine... as he is sitting there with a f--kin' black eye."&nbsp;</p><p>Watch Jersey Shore: Family Vacation Thursdays at 8 p.m. EST on MTV.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsButsSnZKGZoqGyunnPq5ygppGjwW6txpqgpw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
