Source: InstagramFor many of us, saying nice things about Logan Paul is nearly impossible. The YouTube star glorified suicide in a 2018 YouTube video and made extremely questionable comments about abortion as recently as last year. 
But apparently, the famous YouTuber, avid prankster, and washed-up Vine star is an extremely talented wrestler."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In fact, when Logan went to college for a year, he made it onto his school's Division 1 wrestling team.</p><p>Before the eldest Paul brother somehow rose to internet fame, <a href=#>Logan Paul's wrestling record in college</a> and in high school was pretty phenomenal, which explains why he wants to wrestle all of these influencers. Either way, though, let the records show we still can't stand the bleach blonde internet personality, regardless of his somewhat impressive athletic abilities.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Logan Paul wrestled in both high school and college, and was apparently quite good at it.</h2><p>Although he may not look like a typical athlete, it turns out Logan was a total hot-shot in high school athletics. According to Patch, he was an all-star high school football player, and was even better at wrestling. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took fifth place in OHSAA State Championships</a> during his senior year of high school, and ultimately decided to join the wrestling team at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, where he enrolled to study industrial engineering.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, during his short time at Ohio, Logan ended up <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">qualifying for the school's wrestling championships</a>, according to Metro US. Considering the fact that the school is NCAA-Division 1 for wrestling, that's a pretty impressive feat. However, the YouTuber ended up deciding to drop out of school in 2014 at the end of his freshman year to move to Los Angeles and further pursue his career as a YouTuber, and thus, his wrestling career was officially over.</p><p>This explains why <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Logan Paul is offering $10,000 to influencers to wrestle him</a>. Per News Week, MMA fighter Dillon Danis offered Logan $1 million to beat him, and pro-wrestler Elijah Burke offered him $15,000. Others who responded included: MMA fighter Mike Davis, ex-hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz, YouTuber James Charles, MMA fighter Tara LaRosa, YouTuber Joel Morris, comedian Fakkah Fuzz, pro-wrestler Joseph Janela, pro-wrestler Thunder Rosa, and pro-wrestler Ethan Page.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>OU Supervine tomorrow ...

At one point, <a href=#>he fought fellow YouTuber KSI</a>, which he detailed on his YouTube channel, and he ended up losing pretty badly. A few months later, he appealed the loss, but his appeal was apparently rejected.</p><p>Afterwards, despite his epic boxing loss against KSI, Logan decided he wanted to fight "a real boxer," and said he thought he could take down British professional boxer and two-time heavyweight champion <a href=#>Anthony Joshua</a>. However, the two never ended up facing off in the boxing ring... the fight most likely would have been pretty short, if you catch our drift.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Clearly Logan Paul really misses school sports, but alas, it seems like his glory days in the athletics department may be over.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfobyorc1mp5qtnGLEs7HSraOippdisLC4y56eng%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
