With hits like “Do It” and “Baby Girl” from their Grammy-nominated album “Ungodly Hour,” the sisters have established themselves as a force to be reckoned with. Despite their joint success, rumors of the pair going solo have been a hot topic and it looks like they may be true.</p><p>Chloe Bailey has been serenading fans on social media with flawless music covers. She even performed solo for the first time in July 2021, which has led to fans asking one key question: Is Chloe Bailey going solo?
