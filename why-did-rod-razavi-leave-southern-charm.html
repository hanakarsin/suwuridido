Although he was a newcomer to fans, he was already friends with several guys, including Austen Kroll."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

If this is true, it likely has to do with Olivia Flowers’s not returning to the show. In Season 9, Rod took a step back from dating Olivia after she tragically lost her brother to an accidental fentanyl overdose.</p><p>The 32-year-old confirmed her departure from the show during a July 12 episode of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scheananigans with Scheana Shay</a> podcast. “I’m not on this new season. So, I have a lot more free time,” she said, adding, “I was super bummed.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Olivia hinted at this not being her choice.</h2><p>“I have this new relationship and I’m choosing another path,” she said. “But I got the call a few weeks before filming from the production company. It was just, kind of, asking the questions like, ‘You don’t really seem to be in Charleston that much.’”</p><p>While production alluded to her choosing a “different path,” she said this wasn’t the case. “I was like, ‘I don’t think it’s choosing a different path.’ I’m just, kind of, living my life,” Olivia continued.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Olivia Flowers (@oliviabflowers)</a></p></figure><p>“Mind you, at the time, my parents had just officially moved to Texas, and I was wanting to be closer to them.

Thankfully, Rod has a full career to keep him busy. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to his LinkedIn</a>, Rod has a background in computer programming. He has been the director of the Zuri Group since 2013. He has also been the director of ChemoCars since 2017.</p><p>There is a chance that he was never a full-time cast member to begin with. In an Instagram post, Rod shared that he was a last-minute addition.</p><p>“I had no idea what to expect when I got the call that they wanted me as a last minute addition to the cast, and there would’ve been no way to prepare me for what was to come,” he wrote.</p><p>He went on to say that he had 12 hours to decide if he wanted to be on the show or not.</p><p>“Anyone that knows me knows I am conflict averse, and tend to over-communicate my way around any awkwardness or drama,” he wrote.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Rod Razavi (@rodrazavi)</a></p></figure><p>“Bravo chose to look past that atypical reality TV trait and bring me on the show anyways, and for that I want to say thank you to everyone involved in bringing me on Southern Charm," he continued. "I think I was seen as a good fit due to my long standing relationships with the cast, but also because of my strong connection to the city of Charleston."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aqn5l6s63Zmq2iZZyarrexjKymrqyYmr%2BvecKhmKul</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
