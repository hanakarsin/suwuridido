I tried to speak to him about issues but it had always earned me hate. I tried to see him at a point but he shut the door at me,” the Senator added.</p><p>He continued by saying “I have not made public declaration about becoming a governor but there have been innuendos, insinuations. People have also been putting pressure on me to run for governor. And I overheard someone say that the only condition for me to sit with him (Ishaku) is if I would drop my gubernatorial ambition.”</p><p>Bwacha concluded that the political persecution he’s been suffering at the Taraba State level of the PDP made him dump the party after due consultation with his supporters and constituency members.</p><p>“It is about an environment where you are not being persecuted, where you are given a latitude to operate, a free playing ground.</p><p>“My people are not in support of such persecution, they see me going through persecution that is unnecessary,” he noted.</p><p>“If you are staying in an environment where you will not survive, if you remain there, you are doing it at your own peril and I would not be part of such danger, I won’t endanger my political future in an environment where I am not guaranteed a clear future,” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49sZqCnpmK2tLTApKysZZiWwbOxw2adqKpdorJuucCdnGallWKxtrnPZqedqF2bvLN5wKmaZpqnlrCprY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
