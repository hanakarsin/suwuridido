She also said that there was a misconception that she got pregnant with Stephen's baby when in reality, it was with some random man that she had a one-night stand with, and Brown paid for her abortion.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/24f635254a5b125a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The chronicle of the life and career of Keri Russell</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The former nanny said that she wishes her ex-employer and lover treated her with respect like she did over the past seven years. She even mentioned that Melanie's children wrote her thank-you cards.</p><p class=align-left>It was reported that the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">true reason</a> behind Mel and Lorraine's conflict was the nanny knowing more about her relationship with her estranged husband than anyone else, meaning that she could use the information in court. Lorraine was also thought to own private videos of their encounters, even though she refuted this claim.</p><p class=align-left>Since then, the case has been settled, as the Scary Spice reportedly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">agreed to pay</a> Lorraine £1.8million.</p><h3>Mel B children</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9277a6feaa10d015.jpg><p class=align-left>The celebrity has three daughters from three different men.
