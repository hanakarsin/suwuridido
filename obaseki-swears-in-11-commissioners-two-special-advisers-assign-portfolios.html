In enthroning a high-performance culture, an organizational performance scorecard has been developed for each ministry.</p><p>“The scorecard will be deployed in tracking key performance targets and deliverables of each Ministry and reports will be demanded on a quarterly basis. A formal assessment of performance targets and results achieved by each Ministry shall be conducted. These shall form the basis of further review and linkages to other key human resource processes.”</p><p>He continued: “On our part, we have articulated, in the MEGA Agenda, a vision of where we want Edo State to be before 2050. Making Edo Great Again and Edo becoming the best state to live and prosper in Nigeria are promises we have made to the good people of Edo State who massively turned out to vote for this Government in September 2020.</p><p>“As Commissioners and Special Advisers, the height of people’s expectations of you and the Government you represent are unprecedented. We have no choice but to meet and deliver on the expectations of the people. As we serve the people, we must become champions of high performance, disciplined in execution and results-oriented.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe49vZqiakaiyrLWMrK6emaKoeqq6jGpoZpuforqqv9Kipqedoqh6tcPOZqqpnZOerq15wJ2toquVp8BurdKsoKCmXaW8s8DFqKOip6Nk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
