Source: YouTubeCall me nosy, but over the last two years or so, Anthony Bourdain's younger brother has crossed my mind more than once. What has Christopher been up to since his last on-screen appearance on Parts Unknown back in 2015? And how has he been coping with not only the passing of both his older brother almost two years ago in 2018, but also the death of his 85-year-old mother, Gladys, which unfortunately happened just a few days ago?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

What has Christopher been up to since his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">last on-screen appearance on Parts Unknown</a> back in 2015? And how has he been coping with not only the passing of both his older brother almost two years ago in 2018, but also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the death of his 85-year-old mother,</a> Gladys, which unfortunately happened just a few days ago?&nbsp;</p><p>While I've been simultaneously procrastinating — and also processing the grief the Bourdains have endured these last couple of years — I decided to do a little sleuthing on the youngest Bourdain brother. And even though not much information regarding Christopher is public, I was able to find out a bit about him. So here is absolutely everything we know about the late chef's youngest (and only) sibling.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Anthony Bourdain's brother is currently working in finance in New York City.</h2><p>Unlike his older brother, a chef, author, and T.V. personality, and his mother, a critically-acclaimed writer, Christopher decided to pursue a more "traditionally lucrative" career path in finance. He tends to stay under the radar, so his current place of employment is not public. However, according to TODAY, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he works as a banker</a> somewhere in the Big Apple.</p><p>And despite the fact that Christopher didn't decide to pursue a culinary career, he still appreciates the finer things in life. He attributes his and Anthony's passion for adventurous eating to his parents — growing up near New York City in Leonia, New Jersey, made interesting food tremendously accessible, and their parents always brought them to different kinds of restaurants. &nbsp;</p><p>"A thing that was particularly nice that influenced Tony was our parents influencing us to try new things. We ate Danish in New York, we went to Chinatown regularly. When Indian showed up in the 1970s, we tried it. When sushi was a new thing in the '70s, we tried it," Christopher told TODAY. So, that explains a lot about their family dynamic.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Christopher is a father of two kids.</h2><p>Despite the fact that there is almost no public information on Christopher's highly private family life, we know for a fact that the NYC-based financier has fathered two children. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gladys Bourdain's New York Times obituary</a> from earlier this week, it's mentioned that she's survived by three grandchildren. Anthony only ever fathered one child —&nbsp;12 year old Ariane Bourdain — so clearly, Christopher is a father of two.</p><p>With that, fans of the Bourdain family don't know much about the ages, or about the mother of Christopher Bourdain's two children. But we find solace in the fact that he has at least three surviving family members, including Ariane Bourdain.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Their mother, Gladys, was an incredible writer.</h2><p>For many years, from 1984 through 2008, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gladys worked as a copy editor at The New York Times</a>. She ended up playing a major part in helping Anthony while he was trying to jumpstart his writing career, according to The New York Times, but sadly passed away at a hospice facility in the Bronx on Friday, Jan. 10 from increasingly debilitating health problems. She was 85 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>Our hearts go out to Christopher during this difficult time — we're wishing him the best.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflru1tM6nsGaan6q%2Fpa3Ip2Sbqp%2Bptaa%2B</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
