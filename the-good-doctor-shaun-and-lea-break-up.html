Our main man, Shaun, has finally won over Lea and they seem to be happier than ever. But as they face obstacle after obstacle in their relationship, we‚Äôre forced to ask if they‚Äôre going to break up.</p><p>Now, we obviously hope Shaun and Lea make it through any struggles they have to face, but The Good Doctor wouldn‚Äôt be as good as it is if there wasn‚Äôt some drama along the way! And recently, <a href=#><u>Shaun and Lea</u></a> have come up against one of their biggest hurdles yet: pregnancy. So, are Shaun and Lea about to call it quits? Let‚Äôs investigate.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Shaun and Lea could break up on ‚ÄòThe Good Doctor.‚Äô</h2><p>Shaun and Lea have had their fair share of tragedies to deal with this season of <a href=#><u>The Good Doctor</u></a>, but nothing can compare to what they went through in Season 4, Episode 16's ‚ÄúDr. Ted.‚Äù Essentially, they were faced with a pregnancy pretty early on in their relationship.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>For most couples who haven‚Äôt been dating very long, a pregnancy is out of the question. But for <a href=#><u>Shaun and Lea</u></a>, who are basically meant to be together, things are a bit more complicated than that. Lea didn‚Äôt think she was ready, but Shaun really wanted to have the baby because he‚Äôs so in love with her.&nbsp;</p><p>The pregnancy created a great deal of tension between the two of them, and some viewers expected that disagreement alone would lead to the couple's split.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">On ‚ÄòThe Good Doctor,‚Äô Shaun and Lea came to an agreement, but another tragedy came their way.</h2><p>Lea decided that she wanted to get an abortion. However, when the couple got to the abortion clinic, Lea changed her mind. At that point, when she was really in the thick of it, she came to the decision that she wanted to have a baby with Shaun, who she knew would be there for her no matter what. But then, tragedy struck.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Lea ended up in the hospital due to what the doctor called a ‚Äúroutine complication,‚Äù but Shaun was skeptical. He made a whole list of the possibilities, and their friend, Claire, used that list to discover that Lea had a condition affecting her blood vessels. This meant immediate surgery.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">If Lea and Shaun break up, it would be devastating to fans of ‚ÄòThe Good Doctor.‚Äô</h2><p>With Lea‚Äôs surgery, the couple had to choose to either induce labor for a stillbirth, or do a D&R, which is basically a surgical abortion. Wanting to avoid the trauma of giving birth to a baby they couldn‚Äôt bring home, they opted for the D&R. However, that experience was also traumatic.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>if the writers use this as an excuse to break up lea and shaun i am going to fucking throw something, i'm already mad, we deserve to see autistic characters in healthy loving relationships <a href=#>#TheGoodDoctor</a></p>‚Äî awl ü¶âüêª (@awlbie) <a href=#>May 11, 2021</a> <span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Because of the hardship Lea and Shaun faced together, many fans are wondering if a breakup is on the horizon. On the other hand, it could have brought them closer together, but there‚Äôs really no way of knowing.&nbsp;</p><p>While many fans of the show are expecting the writers to throw a wrench into <a href=#><u>Shaun and Lea‚Äôs relationship</u></a>, the only way we‚Äôll know what happens for sure is by tuning into the next episode.</p><p>Watch new episodes of The Good Doctor Mondays at 10 p.m. EST on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWmecaopp1llKSwtbvRZqqhmaWjeqK6w2ajnpldl7%2BmrcpmrKk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
