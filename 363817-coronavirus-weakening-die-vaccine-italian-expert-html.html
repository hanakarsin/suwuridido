"Now, in the past four weeks, patterns have changed and there could be lower viral load in the respiration system probably due to a genetic mutation in the virus which has not yet been demonstrated scientifically," he added.<p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Louis Otieno's son Silas Miami confirms he's gay, has married his mzungu lover</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/76ae7d9af6919f64.jpeg><p class=align-left>He said 80 and 90-year-old patients were surviving the virus and breathing with ease but two months ago, they would have needed ventilators.</p><p class=align-left>The expert said there was a likelihood that the virus was mutating and the lower viral load in the body was due to containment measures such as social distancing.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Eldoret pastor narrates how Filipino wife secretly flew to Kenya, helped him become responsible father</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/c6c938345da2e214.jpeg>"Yes, probably it could go away completely without a vaccine. We have fewer and fewer people infected and it could end up with the virus dying out," he told the Telegraph.<p class=align-left>This came a month after a former World Health Organisation (WHO) official said coronavirus was burning out by itself.</p>"There is a real chance that the virus will burn out naturally before any vaccine is developed and I suspect we have more immunity than estimated," Karol Sikora said.<p class=align-left>However, some doctors across the world have been dismissing such claims saying there was no scientific evidence to back the claims that the virus had changed in any way.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
