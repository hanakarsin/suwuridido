I am here, I’m playing every day. Things from outside don’t trouble me, nor does it take that focus away because I’m focused only on here.</p><p>“I handle [the speculation] well. You hear rumours here and there, but I only try to be focused on the club.”</p><p>In line with that, Brighton manager, Roberto de Zerbi said a week ago that he is not bothered about the number of clubs interested in Moises Caicedo.</p><p>The coach noted: “Caicedo is very important for us – I hope he finishes the season with us.</p><p>“It’s always difficult to be certain, but when big teams want our players it’s good news for us.</p><p>“The best solution is that he finishes the season with us.
