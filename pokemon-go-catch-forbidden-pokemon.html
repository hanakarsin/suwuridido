So if you're looking to catch Spiritomb for yourself, here's how you can go about doing it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the Forbidden Pokemon in 'Pokemon GO' and how does one catch it?</h2><p>An encounter with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the Forbidden Pokemon</u></a> (which is also known as Spiritomb) is an incredibly rare occurrence, according to Bulbapedia, however, it’s no shock that Spiritomb is coming out to play on Halloween.&nbsp;</p><p>To be honest, the Forbidden Pokémon is the perfectly creepy character that every scary celebration quite literally needs.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>Like I said, the concept of Spiritomb is truly bone-chilling. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>It takes no physical body</u></a>, however, users will see it in the form of a small rock, according to Bulbapedia. This rock is known as the Odd Keystone.&nbsp;</p><p>Spiritomb is actually made up of a collection of 108 spirits that were trapped in the rock due to "misdeeds" they committed several years ago. Some of these imprisoned spirits are up to 500 years old. Spooooky.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Catching Spiritomb definitely won’t be easy.</h2><p>Considering the fact that Spiritomb is entirely comprised of repressed ghosts, it’s safe to assume catching the Forbidden Pokemon will be a real challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>When the Halloween event starts on Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019 at 1:00 p.m. PDT, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>check for a “spooky message”</u></a> via your Special Research, according to the Pokémon GO website. There, you will see a challenge to catch the elusive Pokémon.&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, there is not too much information regarding where you will be able to find Spiritomb during the Halloween event, what the challenge will be like, or what he even looks like.&nbsp;</p><p>All I know for certain is that you will want to go into it with enough phone battery, Pokéballs, and fighting energy. Facing angry trapped spirits is something you’ll want to be over-prepared for.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Pokemon Go</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Oh, and did I mention the 'Pokemon GO' Halloween event will include costumes and candy?&nbsp;</h2><p>Yes, you heard that loud and clear, folks —&nbsp;Pokémon GO is incorporating the best parts of Halloween into the game, by dressing up Pokémon as other Pokémon.&nbsp;</p><p>While Bulbasaurs might be dressed as Pikachus and Sparrows may be disguised as Pidgeys, some Pokémon might actually wear costumes of themselves, like the Pikachu dressed as a Pikachu, below. It’s meta, it’s adorable, and TBH, I need them.</p><p>In terms of sweets, any and all trainers will receive a double candy reward when any of their Pokémon hatch, transfer, or evolve during the event.</p><p>And while it’s unclear how you’ll receive this double candy, it’s really all I want in life.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>There is a lot to be excited about for Halloween 2019, but there’s no denying that I'm looking forward to catching some Spiritomb the most.&nbsp;</p><p>In all honesty, I’m not trying to sound like Team Rocket right now, but that collection of 108 souls are about to be all mine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbysscyopWafn2KwosDCoWSfp6KXtqWwxKdkqaebmrqwug%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
