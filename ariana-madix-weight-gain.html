Those who haven’t tuned in a while, though, might have found themselves wondering about Ariana Madix’s weight gain during both the premiere and during Watch What Happens Live following the show."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

On Jan. 7, the season premiere of the reality TV show — which features Lisa Vanderpump's employees at SUR — aired on Bravo. Needless to say, viewers were thrilled to see catch up on their favorite stars.</p><p>Those who haven’t tuned in a while, though, might have found themselves wondering about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Madix’s weight gain</a> during both the premiere and during Watch What Happens Live following the show. While Ariana was reiterating the fact that <a href=#>she identifies as bisexual</a> on the after-show — which is actually something she has previously touched upon — &nbsp;many viewers at home couldn’t help but notice the change to the reality TV star’s physical appearance.&nbsp;</p><p>And unfortunately, it certainly wouldn’t be the first time fans fixated on something about Ariana's physical looks.</p><h2><strong>Ariana is no stranger to body-shaming.</strong></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>We think Ariana looks great in 2013 (L) and 2019 (R).</p></figure><p>Almost a year ago, the Vanderpump Rules star opened up with E! News about the body-shaming she endures via social media on a regular basis. Ariana explained that followers tell her she doesn't look like herself or that she looks different “every single time I post any picture.” At the time, the bartender also specifically addressed her weight.</p><p>"I don't think it needs attention but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I've gained over 20 pounds</a> since I started the show the first season,” she told outlet, “and I'm constantly being told that I got filler in my cheeks and I'm very self-conscious about having like a chubby face and I've always wanted an angular jawline and an angular cheekbone so when people say that, I don't think you guys realize how rude you're being.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Ariana went on to say how these types of comments affect her. You're literally pointing out the weight that I've gained in my face and it's kind of upsetting,” she continued. “But at the same time, they've been saying that since day one and what are you going to do?"</p><h2><strong>Ariana has reportedly had plastic surgery.</strong></h2><p>Given the longtime insecurities Ariana about her appearance, the reality TV star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly had plastic surgery done to enhance her cheekbones</a> and jawline. In fact, her plastic surgeon detailed to Bravo exactly what Ariana had done. Except, it didn’t even involve a scalpel.</p><p>Dr. Gregory explained that a technique called Ellevate is “a great procedure for patients that are wanting to be preventative, and/or not ready to completely go under the knife.” He added that it's “the perfect way to restore a youthful appearance and shape” or “to improve a less-desired, genetically inherited neck.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>i’ve been debating posting this for so long but whatever! i’m doing it. officially the spookiest thing i’ve ever experienced! a year ago, i wasnt able to celebrate my favorite holiday bc i had just undergone surgery for melanoma. being told that cancer was living rent free on my body for years was scarier than any 80s slasher movie. thankfully, i had an amazing doctor, the amazing @tomsandoval1 to take care of me, and (as you can see) the @kimpetras #TOTL album to keep me positive! moral of the story: if you’re unsure of something on your body, GET CHECKED and then GET CHECKED AGAIN! #wooahhh #fuckcancer #spookyseason ps- insurance BLOWS. #cancerfree</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>🌙 Ariana Madix 🌙</a> (@ariana252525) on Nov 3, 2019 at 3:56pm PST</p><span>Source: Ariana Madix/Instagram</span></figure><h2><strong>She did have a melanoma scare in late 2018.</strong></h2><p>Viewers also couldn’t help but notice a <a href=#>large scar on the star’s chest</a> during an appearance a the I Heart Radio Alter Ego 2019 music festival in January 2019, according to People.</p><p>One Instagram user incorrectly identified the mark as “a central line placed under the skin to infuse chemo,” to which Ariana pointed out the scar was actually from a “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">large removal of skin from October</a>.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>thankful for my family and my framily 🧡🧡🧡 hope everyone is having the best day today 🧡</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>🌙 Ariana Madix 🌙</a> (@ariana252525) on Nov 28, 2019 at 6:38pm PST</p><span>Source: Ariana Madix/Instagram</span></figure><p>She explained, “Luckily, it should heal vertically, but it’s about 4 inches long.

Because she has no time for the body-shaming. And honestly? Good for Ariana for standing up against the trolls.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2Bqrc2aZKaZlJ7FbsPEop6hrF2crqq6</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
