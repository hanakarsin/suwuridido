This was disclosed by Olorunnimbe Mamora, a deputy director at the party’s presidential campaign office during a press conference at APC national secretariat in Abuja.
Mamora also said fuel scarcity still persisted all over Nigeria, except in the two major cities.
“Across the country, except Lagos and Abuja where fuel scarcity has eased off, due largely to the huge presence of the media and very active civil society, the situation in other parts of Nigeria has been that of pains, anguish and frustration,” he said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He said social and economic activities in most parts of Northern Nigeria, South East and South-South have become almost paralyzed as fuel scarcity bites harder and stronger.</p><p><i>“Motorists and other citizens are paying through their noses to buy above official pump price of N87, a price reduction recently hurriedly announced in an attempt to deceive Nigerians for electoral purpose,”</i> he said.</p><p>Mamora recalled that at the height of the scarcity of fuel three weeks ago, the Nigerian government simply gave excuses and even blamed the APC for the fuel scarcity.</p><p><i>“The Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, NNPC came out afterwards to tell Nigerians the actual reason for this unfortunate development was due to non-payment of about N250b subsidy claims to the major importers coupled with the unstable foreign exchange rates,”</i> he said.</p><p><i>“This is the sorry state of our country today. A major crude oil producing country depends on massive importation of refined petroleum products to meet local consumption,”</i> he said.</p><p>Mamora also said despite the heavy annual subsidy of over N1trillion on Kerosene, the product is not selling at the regulated price of N50/litre and the poor masses who depend on this essential product are buying across Nigeria between N150 and N180/litre.</p><p><i>“The government and its apologists gleefully trumpet that the Nigeria’s rebased economy is the biggest in Africa yet the economy is powered by generators,”</i> he said. <i>“What an irony!</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Rivers PDP Says APC Plot To Assassinate Their Leaders</a></p><p><i>“Businesses are closing down because of the high cost of energy.

This has defiled logic.</i></p><p><i>“Nigerians are asking question why our four refineries are not working at full capacity. They want to know why the country is the only crude oil producer in the world that is the biggest importer of refined products with the associated massive corruption that is feeding the greed of the leaders of the ruling party, the PDP.</i></p><p><i>“These are the issues in this campaign and they are the issues that affect our people. Rather than confronting these issues, the Jonathanians in their Buhariphobia continue to engage in campaign of calumny and hate propaganda against our presidential candidate and other leading lights in our party.”</i></p><p><i>He said the APC and its Presidential Candidate, Mr. Buhari were poised to tackle headlong these hydra headed socio-economic problems and give Nigerians a new lease of life.</i></p><p><i>“This government has failed woefully to meet the yearnings of Nigerians for basic things of life, least of all, availability of petroleum products, with the associated industrial scale corruption,” he said. “As a country and a people we cannot continue in this wicked, destructive and very unsustainable path. The time to save Nigeria and begin a process of rebuilding our country is now,”</i> he said.</p><p>Mamora also took time to talk on Nigeria’s health care system. He said after President Jonathan’s four years in office, the country’s health institutions, most especially at the tertiary level, have witnessed a systemic decay with doctors’ and other health workers’ prolonged labour disputes never seen in history of the country.</p><p>He said salaries of most health workers at the Federal level have not been paid till date.</p><p><i>“In recent World Health Organization Ranking of the World Health Systems, Nigeria was ranked 187 out of 190 countries,”</i> he said. “What a pity!</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>3 APC Senate Presidency Candidates</a></p><p>Mamora added that the APC was outraged and embarrassed beyond words that Jonathan's government could elevate lying as a state policy.</p><p>He said the false claim that Jonathan spoke to Moroccan King Mohammed V1 when no such telephone conversation ever took place has made Nigeria a laughing stock in the eyes of the world.</p><p><i>“It is yet another in the series of lying Presidency,”</i> he said.</p><p>Meanwhile the convoy of Aisha Buhari, the wife of the APC &nbsp;presidential candidate, was on March 16,<a href=#> attacked in Ilorin,</a> Kwara state.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgXF%2FlXBsZp%2BVn8BurcOmoKeho6m%2FosDIqKVmoJGoeqetyKWcnWWkpHqxvs6voJ2dXZeutLXCZqWenZSoeqe70Walop%2BVp7aiutJmpJqln6eub7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
