The secretary of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe made the clarification on Friday in a statement where he observed that some erroneous notions are spreading in some sections of the media that the party is ready to grant Jonathan ‘superior’ waivers and an automatic presidential ticket should he join the party."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Coming into the party gives no one special status of being an automatic party candidate in any election. All aspirants must undergo the nomination processes outlined by the APC constitution.</p><p>“Excerpts of APC NEC 8th December 2020, resolution: “…new members will enjoy all the benefits and privileges accruable by virtue of their membership of the party. So, they will be able to contest for positions in the party. They will be able to contest elections without any requirement of being members for a number of years or period of time,” he observed in the statement.</p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>Governor Dave Umahi</strong> of Ebonyi State has <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>ruled out the possibility</a></strong> of the 2023 presidential ticket getting zoned to the southern region of the country.</p><p>The Governor who spoke on Friday alleged that the southern governors, and most especially, those of them from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are not trustworthy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5BwZmtoYmh6orzCZp6irpWoequ7zZqroZmeYrCwusOiq6KnnmKzsL6Mqameq5mZsq%2FAyJqjZqyZmLimwI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
