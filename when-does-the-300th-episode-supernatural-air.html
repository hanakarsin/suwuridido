If you want to wait to find out how Papa Winchester makes his grand return, we suggest you stop reading now. However, for those who love spoilers, you are in luck because Supernatural's current co-showrunner Andrew Dabb spilled the details to EW. &nbsp;</p><p>"Our guys are put in a position where they essentially can have a wish granted," he explained. "They’re actually expecting something else, but [John’s return] comes from a place of want by Dean. The need for closure is really what brings John back into their lives."&nbsp;</p><p>It was also revealed that John will have a moment alone with each of his sons to allow for that closure. "This episode gives Sam a chance to forgive," Jared said before Jensen added, "For Dean, the whole episode is a dream that he doesn’t want to wake up from. But he knows he has to."&nbsp;</p><p>Papa Winchester will also be reunited with his wife, Mary, who (plot twist) was alive after all. "Everything’s right in the world in this bubble of time,” Samantha Smith, who plays Mary, said. "It’s very romantic."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CW</span></figure><p>This means Papa Winchester is not technically back from the dead, and his return is unfortunately limited to one episode.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is this the last season of Supernatural?&nbsp;</h2><p>Don't get carried away — Jared and Jensen have no plans to end their demon hunting anytime soon.
