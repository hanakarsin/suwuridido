Titled, "Dan's Birthday Bash," Although Bobo was a business owner (he owned his own snowplowing company), he couldn't quite own his temper when he drank.</p><p>He picked a fight with Dan — at Dan's own birthday party — over the use of a pool table at the Lobo Lounge.</p><p>So why is Bobo back in The Conners Season 5, Episode 11?
