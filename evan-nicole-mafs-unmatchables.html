Source: LifetimeThough idea of marrying a perfect stranger and then spending several concentrated weeks with said stranger sounds like a nightmare to many, more than 65,000 people have applied to be on Married at First Sight since it first debuted in 2014.
Only a select few have been matched over the years, meaning that there are still many hopeful singles who want to find lasting love in front of the cameras."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She's a "Bossy Bathroom Lover."</h2><p>The 24-year-old is the youngest "unmatchable" contestant on the MAFS spin-off series, and her main issue is that she spends too much time on the toilet... literally.</p><p>Pastor Cal and Dr. Viviana have identified a few major reasons why each MAFS: Unmatchables star has been unable to find love. For Evan-Nicole, it's the fact that she does accomplishes many tasks while sitting on the toilet.</p><p>The hairdresser makes no excuses for the fact that she tends to eat meals and answer Facetimes while she's in the bathroom. When it comes to going on dates, Evan-Nicole has incredibly high standards, and she has a pattern of interrogating the men she's out with.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of this, Pastor Cal thinks that the best way to get Evan-Nicole outside of her comfort zone is to set her up on a blind date.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lifetime</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Pastor Cal wants Evan-Nicole to go on a blind date, which makes her "nervous."</h2><p>In the exclusive clip, Pastor Cal explains to Evan-Nicole that she can never be on a show like MAFS unless she's willing to put in some work.&nbsp;</p><p>"On Married at First Sight, we set people up for marriage, hopefully, for life. Before you get to marriage, you got to be dateable," Pastor Cal says in the clip. "So, what's going to happen here is that, Dr. Viviana and I, we're going to send you on a blind date."</p><p>Evan-Nicole's is surprised by the blind date idea, though her friend notes that "this is what she needs."</p><p>"Hopefully we can get from dating to eventually matrimony!" Pastor Cal continues.</p><p>Though Evan-Nicole is excited at the mention of marriage, Pastor Cal then offers her a bit of a reality check.</p><p>"It's not going to be easy, girl. I'm going to take you out [of] your comfort zone," the show's expert adds.</p><p>After Pastor Cal explains his idea, Evan-Nicole shares how she's feeling in a confessional.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>"I am most nervous about a blind date, because it's not something that I have control over. But, I'm just ready for it — for someone to go on this roller coaster ride with me. I'm tired of doing it by myself. I'm tired."</p><p>By the end of the clip, Evan-Nicole is more than ready to go on her blind date — and she locks it in by high fiving Pastor Cal.&nbsp;</p><p>How will it turn out? You'll have to tune in to see.</p><p>MAFS: Unmatchables is produced by Kinetic Content.
