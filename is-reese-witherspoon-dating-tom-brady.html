Especially since one of these celebs just announced their divorce a few days before the rumors started. Talk about wasting absolutely no time getting back on the field, missy! Letâ€™s discuss the possible courtship of America's sweetheart and the G.O.A.T. â€” aka <a href=#>Reese Witherspoon</a> and <a href=#>Tom Brady</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty images</span><p>Reese Witherspoon and ex-husband Jim Toth (left), Tom Brady and ex-wife Gisele BÃ¼ndchen (right)</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Are Reese Witherspoon and Tom Brady dating?</h2><p>According to an anonymous tip sent to celebrity gossip account <a href=#>Deuxmoi</a>, Reese and Tom are allegedly dating.

I mean, can you think of any two other celebs that that tip could be referring to? Exactly. There aren't any.</p><p>Not to mention, the insider who submitted the tip also used the email address legallyblonde@patriotsbuncanners.com, which should be proof enough.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Canâ€™t get the possibility of Tom and Reese dating out of my head thx <a href=#>@deuxmoiworld</a> <a href=#>#THISLEAGUE</a> <a href=#>#nfl</a></p>â€” Kristen (@KBDitka) <a href=#>March 29, 2023</a></figure><p>As a refresher, <a href=#>Reese announced her divorce from Hollywood agent Jim Toth</a> via Instagram on March 24.

His divorce from model <a href=#>Gisele BÃ¼ndchen</a> was announced in early 2022 and finalized on Oct. 28 of that year.

All we know is that this is wild!</p><p>While not every submission Deuxmoi receives is necessarily the truth, Tom and Reese have had some time to correct the news if it was incorrect.
