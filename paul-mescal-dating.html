Unfortunately, he no longer has an Instagram account that we can check to see if he's been posting up a bae, but generally speaking, Paul has always been a rather private person. If he does have a significant other, he hasn’t shared them with the public yet.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Paul Mescal allegedly called off his engagement with Phoebe Bridgers in 2022.</h2><p>Paul was previously in a serious relationship with indie singer <a href=#>Phoebe Bridgers</a>, but it is believed to have ended. They were first seen flirtatiously interacting on Twitter in May 2020. In the months following, rumors swirled that they were an item.</p><p>Finally, in November 2021, they made things official when they stepped out on the red carpet for the first time as a couple. A month later, Phoebe made their relationship Instagram official. Their courtship was very popular amongst fans.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Phoebe Bridgers (@phoebebridgers)</a></p></figure><p>It wasn't too long before fans started hearing talk that Paul and Phoebe were engaged. But shortly after that, things took a turn for the worse. A new rumor claimed that Phoebe was hooking up with comedian and filmmaker <a href=#>Bo Burnham</a>.</p><p>Fans, hoping for the best, chalked this up to be an open relationship. But then celebrity gossip account <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DeuxMoi</a> received a tip from a “very reliable source” which gave more insight into what allegedly happened — and it wasn't the ending fans were hoping for.</p><p>The tip, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jezebel</a>, read, “Can confirm the engagement is off between Paul Mescal and Phoebe Bridgers. It’s not an open relationship in the slightest.
