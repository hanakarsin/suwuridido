But in breaking it open, they can do it by stealth rather than by brigandage. Some of us have spent our time at the barricade. In the better time of my younger days, I was also a #EndSARS protester of sorts as you know. But I knew when to stop and when to start negotiating with those in power and authority and ultimately, we made some progress.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ze5BqZp6loKG8unnSrZyapKSdeqW%2Bzqlkm6qZnK6vsMCgnGaeka6yrrWMnqWdq5GnwG680airnqukmr%2B0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
