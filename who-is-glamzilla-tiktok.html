TikTok influencer opens up about her journey as a content creator.</h2><p>While some influencers become overnight successes following one viral video, Glamzilla has been actively working hard to build her brand for the past 10 years. After quitting her 9-5 job, Stephanie decided to pursue her dream of being a social media influencer.</p><p>But for the beauty mogul, modeling content off of already successful creators was not in her mindset.</p><p>"I just wanted to be someone who shared her passion," she noted. "Literally, I like lipstick. And I just wanted to share that with the world. ... But like, being a plus-size Asian content creator, I have no choice but to be me."</p><p>"Because there's no one else taking up that space, I have to," she continued. "And it's the only way future content creators can grow."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>For Stephanie, she's interested in showing all facets of her life — the good, the bad, and simply the real.</p><p>"I think people forget social media is just about being social and connecting," she said. "It's not about showing the greatest or the most amazing parts of your life."</p><p>"It's just about being and I just want to be," she added.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">TikTok influencer Glamzilla talks the importance of self-care.</h2><p>While some may associate self-care with going to get a pedicure or taking a long bath, Glamzilla told us that self-care is finding "what's important to us and what works for us" after getting to know ourselves better.</p><p>The influencer's routine starts off with a "really good night's sleep," noting that simple things such as brushing her teeth using Colgate Optic White Pro Series, combing her hair, putting on skincare, and "choosing to be in spaces that make me feel OK to be me" is how she prioritizes self-care.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As for the go-to item that everyone must keep in their beauty kit?</p><p>"Confidence in yourself," she told us.</p><p>"Being scared of makeup, or thinking your routine is not enough [is overrated]," she continued. "Whatever works for you works for you. I think I am kind of over people saying, 'this is a horrible makeup trend, or don't do this.' Do whatever the heck you want. Because I think whatever makes you feel beautiful, whatever makes you feel powerful is exactly what you need to do."</p><p>Yas, queen!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKCkkaLHqrjLmmStoZupvKw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
