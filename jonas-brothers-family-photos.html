Also, please pause to really let this outfit sink in. The attention to detail is really amazing, from the sloppy half-tucked shirt collar to the chunky, handmade quality of the knit on that sweater vest. It really says "Grandma worked her arthritic fingers to the bone to make that for you and you will wear it on picture day."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>And the spread wouldn't truly capture the spirit of Awkward Family Photos without this double-exposure effect that was so popular in the pre-digital camera age of studio portraits that have inspired a ton of memes over the years.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Jo Bros invited fans to share their own photos, and they didn't disappoint.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Several shared photos where they are eerily similar to the images the brothers are parodying.
