Squeeze themselves into the person's car and then pull out their vehicle for them: "I would have just asked for the persons keys and pulled out the car so they could get it."</p><p>There were a few folks who thought that the vehicle was Jonny's and he was pretending to be outraged...at himself: "Plot twist...it's his Tesla and now he has to wait it out"</p><p>Another remarked: "why was i expecting him to unlock it and get in? lol"</p><p>Jonny gave some additional context into the situation in a few of the responses he penned in the comments section of the video: "its in between 2 spots. 1 cord is for handicap access to the charger"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jonny2lobes</span></figure><p>As for the fate of the vehicles, he didn't know what happened, just that the woman in the wheelchair wanted the car towed but that ultimately, neither of the cars were there: "she got it handled is all I can assume as both vehicles were gone went I got back. she was waiting for the police and looking to get the vehicle gone"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbK0uMBmn5qmlJ6woryMrKeorA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
