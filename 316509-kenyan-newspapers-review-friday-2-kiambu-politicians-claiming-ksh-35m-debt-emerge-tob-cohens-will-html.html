class=align-left>With less than 20 days left to discuss and conclude debate, 39 county assemblies have not considered the document.</p><p class=align-left>There are indication that only six counties are likely to pass the bill adding the number to seven after Uasin Gishu county voted for it.</p><p class=align-left>Some counties have resorted to hold public hearings on the bill before voting for it in what supporters of Punguza Mizigo interpret as strategy by the opponents to derail the process which is supposed to be concluded in three months.</p><img

Nation</strong></p><p class=align-left>President Uhuru Kenyatta's backyard in Gatundu South is slowly turning into a hot bed of criminals terrorising residents day and night.</p><p class=align-left>So cunning are the criminals that they break into houses at night, carry household items away, and demand residents to use Fuliza service to get them loans from their mobile phones.</p><p class=align-left>On Thursday, September 26, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i visited the area and apologised to the residents over the level of insecurity in the area.</p><p class=align-left>A tough talking Matiang'i told the residents he had been sent by the head of state and assured them government was determined to deal with the criminals.</p><img

Star</strong></p><p class=align-left>Late tycoon Tob Cohen's embattled widow Sarah Wairimu has dismissed reports that her husband owed two politicians from Kiambu county over KSh 35 million.</p><p class=align-left>In an affidavit, Wairimu told the court that she had read in the newspapers about Cohen's will and that her husband owed nobody such amount of money.</p>"I further learnt that the will opening ceremony was attended by a politician, one Patrick Muiruri and that two Kiambu politicians were claiming to be owed a sum of Sh 35 Million by my late husband,” read the affidavit.<p class=align-left>On Thursday, September 26, Wairimu asked the court to free her so that she can fight for her rights after she heard Cohen's sister Gabriele Van Straten and her brother Benard Cohen will be filing for probate to execute the will.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

series of austerity measures in a bid to save money to finance the Big Four Agenda.</p><p class=align-left>Top in the list of the "not to do things" is that senior government officials will not be allowed to use public vehicles over weekend without approval from accounting officers in the ministries and government departments.</p><p class=align-left>In the new guidelines, government officials have also been encouraged to be making calls using the internet in order to save money.</p>“The guidelines apply to all ministries, department and agencies (MDAs) in the national government, Judiciary, Parliament, independent officers and commissions,” Yatani’s circular read in part.<p class=align-left>Also, all staff training will only be conducted within the country and that newspapers given to staff should be rationalised to restrict the spending.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

down requests by some politicians to turn Kieleweke and Tanga Tanga into political parties.</p><p class=align-left>Registrar Anne Nderitu declined to register the names saying they did not comply with the Constitution, particularly the Political Parties Act 2011.</p>"Further to this and without prejudice upon registration of the party, the name shall not be in line with the Article 91 of the Constitution of Kenya. Kindly suggest other names for verification," she said.<p class=align-left>Also on the blacklist was Team Mafisi which also wanted to be registered as a political movement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/b905e2e9b3a4c36c.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
