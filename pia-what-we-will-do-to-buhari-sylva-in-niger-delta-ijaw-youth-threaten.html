We believe strongly that will be the only sure path upon which our God-given natural resources can be managed by us and not this impunity we have witnessed from a repressive federal government under President Muhammadu Buhari.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5FpZqmhkWLEqa3TZq6eZaeeua15w6hkraddl8KprdGiZKyxnKuubrXNZqWin5WneqWxy62YZqGalsRuxc6uq6FlpJ2%2Fpq3TnqVo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
