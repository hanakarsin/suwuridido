I also think the oil production benchmark of 1.69mbpd is realistic given the assurance by the President that the NNPC Limited is doing something to curb oil theft and pipeline vandalism.</p><p>“It is, however, worrisome that capital expenditure as a proportion of total spending has gone down well below the government target of 30 per cent while debt service at over N6tn is in excess of the amount budgeted for capital expenditure.”</p><p>On his part, however, the Chief Executive Officer, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, <strong>Muda Yusuf</strong>, said the 2023 federal government budget has further amplified the troubling fiscal outlook for the economy.</p><p>Expenditure according to him, has further accelerated amid consistent weak revenue performance.</p><p>“We have a budget of N20.51tn naira and revenue projection of N9.73tn naira. This is a deficit of 10.78tn. In all probability, the deficit will be much bigger by year-end because of the track record of revenue under performance over the last couple of years.</p><p>“We are also likely to see an acceleration of CBN financing of the fiscal deficit given the revenue performance trajectory. The public debt stock is growing and currently at N42tn,”&nbsp;Yusuf said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BpZmtoYmh6o8HDoJytZaCau7S1zqeqZp%2BilsG2tdOinKxloprBqr7EnqpmmpWjsqe102arqGWXqrmxec1xbG1laJe7cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
