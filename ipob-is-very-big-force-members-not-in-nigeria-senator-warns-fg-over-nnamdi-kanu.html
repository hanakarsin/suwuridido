The proposed sit-at-home protest would affect the Anambra governorship election which is billed for November 6.</p><p>While noting that boycotting the forthcoming election “doesn’t really help our people”, Ubah told Arise News: “You must understand that <strong>Nnamdi Kanu</strong> has a lot of followership in the south-east. So, the government should take him seriously. But we are engaging and finding political solutions to this issue.</p><p>“We are engaging with IPOB and showing them the importance of this election. The most important thing is that the election is constitutional, and I’m also very much sure that on the day of the election, there would be a peaceful election in Anambra state.”</p><p>The YPP governorship candidate had filed a motion on October 15 through his counsel, Agugoesi Ikem, who sought, “an order of this honourable court granting leave to Sen. Ifeanyi Ubah to visit the defendant, Nnamdi Kanu, as part of his legislative oversight function”.</p><p>Ubah said, “I am the only politician that’s working hard to see the reader of the indigenous people of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, so that I can also have the opportunity of talking to him and get him to talk to his people to look into the issue. Because the election is constitutional, and if really anybody loves our people, they shouldn’t be saying there will be no election.</p><p>“It doesn’t really help our people. If there’s no election, there will be voters apathy, and somebody might come in and then do something that might not augur well.</p><p>“IPOB is a very big force because most of them are not even in Nigeria. And they have their way with the media, and people are listening to them. So, that’s why I have dedicated myself to how we can bring in and proffer a political solution.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5FuZqKon5d6qr%2BMr5yrsV2Xtqh5xaipnJ1dorKursSrqmamn6l6qrqMp6CgnaKerm6%2FxKeYraeiYsSivs2sZJ%2BfXaTDpr6Mp6WapZSeeqytza5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
