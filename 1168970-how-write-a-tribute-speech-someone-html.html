Some examples: When my brother's daughter was born, my mom literally made a huge bouquet out of baby socks — she rolled the socks into little rose shapes and stuck them onto wires, and it was amazing. For the family dogs, she slow-cooked their dog bones herself. They would sit there on the stove stewing for hours. It was like some artisanal butcher shop in Brooklyn. She would buy my cat treats and toys even though she did not even like cats. She even insisted on getting him an organic hemp scratching post. Despite the fact that we were all in our 20s and 30s when she passed, my mom would still send me, and my three siblings themed packages for every holiday — literally every holiday: Easter, Halloween, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, you name it. Usually, the packages have themed socks in them. She was so next level, it was insane.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/cd28a2e54dcdf6a1.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50 lovely flower quotes to brighten up your mood for spring</span></p></a>Plus, she gave the most comforting hugs ever.<p class=align-left>This eulogy for a mother has amazing elements of nature, care, and love. Such kind words would also be nice for any other relative, friend, or colleague. You can write something more touching.</p><h3>How to write a tribute to my late father</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/0a0e01e511eaae62.jpeg><p class=align-left>Here is a sample tribute to a beloved father from his son or daughter.</p>My father is a defender of our family. He is an example of the perfect husband and father. When I studied at school, our family was poor. My father was a simple factory worker. And my mom couldn’t work for health reasons. However, our defender wanted to give us a better future. That’s why he worked nights. I found out later that he also was a guard in the local flower shop. My father agreed with the shop owner that he will work only at night. As you understand, he slept very little and got a lot of health problems. However, now he has a son who is the best doctor in our locality. I provide him free high-quality treatment and carefree old age. My father gave me everything and I want to give him twice as much. He deserves the best in this world. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/8a4b1b7e85290ddc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Zig Ziglar quotes that will inspire you to unleash your true potential</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Of course, these are very simple and short sample tributes.

Every detail is important if you were happy together.</p><h2>Sample tribute speech for deceased</h2><p class=align-left>Here is a sample tribute written to pay respect to a deceased friend.</p>Carol Smith was a very dear friend of mine. When we met years ago, we both had just moved to New York City. I had dreams of becoming a model, and she was looking for a fresh start. We both loved the big city. We lived next door to each other, and both came from small towns, so it worked out perfectly. We were friends from the moment that we met each other. Carol was one of the most supportive people that I have met. She was always there to lend an ear when I needed someone to listen. A hug was always just a few steps away. She was constantly there to offer support for anything and everything I wanted to do, no matter how big or small. When I got rejected by modelling agencies, she insisted they were crazy, and missing out on the best model. That was Carol. She was always there to encourage everyone around her. She always tried to lift up your spirits when you were feeling down. I only knew Carol for a few short years, but that was enough time to realize how amazing she was. I'm glad that I got to spend that time with her and that I had the pleasure of knowing someone as sweet as Carol. Thank you all.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/651120d3328bde87.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Brene Brown quotes that address love, vulnerability and shame</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A tribute speech is a good opportunity to show some love and respect to a person.
