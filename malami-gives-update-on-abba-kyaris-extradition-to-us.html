But there is a great misconception or perhaps either mischievous or otherwise on the path of certain journalists that have not taken their time to study a solution, understand it and act accordingly.</p><p>“Well, you see there is the aspect associated with the case of Abba Kyari that is being handled at the international level, particularly the US. And the US, arising from the case of Hushpuppi, sent in an extradition request. I think you should get that clear.</p><p>“They sent in a request for extradition related to Abba Kyari. And the way and manner these things are done with particular regards to the extradition, the office of the attorney-general, upon receipt of an international extradition request, usually presents the same before the judiciary for consideration.</p><p>“So, the conclusion as to whether a person should be extradited or not is a function, or perhaps multilateral function inclusive of the international committee that makes a request, the office of the attorney-general diversity request and the judiciary, to which the request is presented for review, analysis and decision. So, that is the case presented on account of the request of the international community, the US associated with Abba Kyari. That one is a distinct, separate and clear case.</p><p>“And that brings about the operation, application and enforcement of the Nigerian law. And then, apparently arising from that, he was charged in a different field altogether unrelated to the case at the international level. So, what you have are two distinctly separate and independent cases, one international in dimension the other one local.</p><p>“So, your idea of conflict does not arise. But the idea of misconception is the creation on the part of journalists, perhaps reporting cases out of context without caring to understand the true provisions, dimensions and characters of the case. What I am saying is that there is nothing like confusion, there is nothing like conflict, there are two distinct and separate cases.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5BwZqaZnJa6qnnGoq2eq12qvaWt055kqKZdlq%2BjrYyksJqqmah6psTTq5idoaSevK9506hkrqtf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
