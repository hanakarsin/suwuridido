Sure, most people are reasonable and understanding. But every once in a while, you interact with a truly irrational human being, someone whose behavior can only be described by the phrase "brain worms." And of course, those are the encounters that customer service workers remember most vividly.&nbsp;</p><p>Twitter user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@Keally22</a>, who goes by Kels, a former customer service worker herself, asked people who've had similar jobs to share the customer complaints that "broke" them, the interactions that they simply couldn't believe were happening even as they were literally happening in front of them. And oh man, these will boil the blood of any normal, reasonable person.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Customer service workers what is the complaint that broke you?</p><p>I‚Äôm 18, Red Robin host, Mother‚Äôs Day 10 min after open. Only 1 section open, I seat 3 families. Instantly cussed out hard bc I ruined Karen in white jeans Mother‚Äôs Day bc they could see other people from their table</p>‚Äî Kelsüñ§ (@Keally22) <a href=#>November 14, 2020</a></figure><p>Kels started off the thread with a couple of stories of her own. This one is off-the-charts. This "Karen" complained that she could see other people from their table on a very busy Mother's Day. Has she...ever eaten at a restaurant before? That's how restaurants literally always work. But this wasn't the only story Kels had from her time in the customer-service trenches.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This was the story I wanted to go w but it was too long so I‚Äôm notes apping it bc it still makes me just speechless. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/oEEcq5jVgv</a></p>‚Äî Kelsüñ§ (@Keally22) <a href=#>November 14, 2020</a></figure><p>This one was so long she needed to use the Notes app to write it all out. Basically, this horrible woman would simply not believe that Kels gave her the right sauce on her pizza, and she made her remake the pizza three times even though Kels got it right the first time. Customer service workers are truly saints. This is why regular, normal people should be extra nice whenever you encounter someone just trying to do their job.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>a lady tried to get me fired n screamed at me because i closed the drive thru and then another lady tried to get me fired bc i told her that extra sauce was extra</p>‚Äî hancake (@bowserstanacct) <a href=#>November 14, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>mine was in the drive thru guy orders a combo i cut him off to ask "beef chicken or steak" he goes "don't you fucking interrupt me" manager made immediate eye contact w me, saw me tearing up and took over while i cried over the dishes lmaooooo it was so small but a terrible day</p>‚Äî CapriCornyCait‚ôëÔ∏è (@CapriCornyCait) <a href=#>November 14, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Customer orders a beef tenderloin plate. Asks how much to add another serving of beef. When I told him, he said that's way too high & nvm. Brought out his food & he asked where was the extra beef he ordered. I apologize & say I thought you didn't want any. He yells at me. I cry.</p>‚Äî Anna Rae Clark (@annaraeoflight) <a href=#>November 14, 2020</a></figure><p>Don't you just love getting yelled at for doing your job correctly? Customer service workers, especially restaurant workers, put up with so much irrational behavior from seemingly normal people. It's like they get into a situation where they feel superior because someone is taking their order and they lose all sense of decency...not to mention logic.&nbsp;</p><p>The man literally said he didn't want the extra serving of beef and then made a fuss when he didn't get it! Like I said, "brain worms."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My first job was at a local pizza joint making salads and sandwiches.

It ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt cold enough‚Äù so we tell her we‚Äôll get her a new one but we just go pour the same one in a new glass, put a new straw and new garnish and bring it back and she goes ‚Äúmuch better, this is how a milkshake should be‚Äù</p>‚Äî Samara (@samgo98) <a href=#>November 15, 2020</a></figure><p>I absolutely love stories like the milkshake one. In a response to this tweet, someone else shared that when they worked at an ice cream shop, a woman complained that she wasn't given "the good ice cream they keep in the back."&nbsp;</p><p>She demanded they remake her shake. So the person took the shake into the back, stood in the freezer for a couple of minutes, and then walked back out with the same exact shake. The woman took it and sipped it smugly before walking off. People love to believe they've gotten some sort of special treatment, whether it be an extra-cold milkshake (which, what?!?!) or the "good, secret ice cream" from the "back," which I guarantee you is not a thing.</p><p>&nbsp;It's almost better when they walk away thinking they've somehow won when you've really just revealed what horrible people they are. The only problem then is that their alternate reality has been validated and they'll probably go through the rest of their life thinking they'll always get the good stuff if they just complain enough.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Delivering pizza, a woman threatened to call the police because her husband tipped me too much while drunk, and my boss made me drive back to give her the money back</p>‚Äî The Last Weyoun (@CTTrekkie) <a href=#>November 15, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>A woman told my manager she should fire me on my second day because I told her she couldn‚Äôt apply her 17 coupons on items that were already on sale</p>‚Äî sophia üñ§ (@sassatico) <a href=#>November 14, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Guy was unhappy with his refund because it was what he paid for it.

How did this man make money by complaining? This shouldn't be allowed to happen. Oo, this one made me irrationally angry.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So many stories. I was a cookie decorator and got yelled out by a wealthy mom (who was using her "play money" to throw her 2yo a birthday party) because the icing didn't exactly match the pantone color of the invitation.</p>‚Äî Meaghan Mountford (@DecoratedCookie) <a href=#>November 14, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>easy<br>i was also a host, this group of middle aged woman came in, one of them with a baby, they asked about vegan options, we didnt have any, so they left, which would be normal if their parting words were not "sorry, the baby is vegan."</p>‚Äî HelloImAce (@ragnarokjatszo) <a href=#>November 14, 2020</a></figure><p>Sometimes you just want to grab people and say, "Listen to the words that are coming out of your mouth. They are ridiculous. You sound like an absolute fool." That's what I would have liked to do to the cookie mom and to the group of women with the vegan baby. Hoo boy.</p><p>Of course, now that we're in the middle of a global pandemic, these sorts of interactions have a new layer of horror associated with them. Several people shared the downright dangerous interactions they've had with customers who wouldn't abide by the regulations their workplaces had established due to COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>When covid first started, I had a customer repeat the tone of everything I said back to me with obnoxious noises bc he said that‚Äôs what I sounded like with my mask on.

Now more than ever, customer service workers are being forced to handle much more than they're getting paid to handle. But at all times, these poor people have to put up with so much. Be nice to your customer service workers. You have no idea who else they're dealing with during their day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmMK0wM6mnKtlo5q%2Ft7XCnmScp52luaK1za2q</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
