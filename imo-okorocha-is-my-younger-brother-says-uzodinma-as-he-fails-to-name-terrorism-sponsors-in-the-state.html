Even the media, both mainstream and social, did not help matters.</p><p>“I want to tell you that instead of naming them I will allow security agencies who are are already investigating those identified to finish their job. Naming them would jeopardize the work of security agencies who are already doing a great job.”</p><p>The Imo Governor however singled out the current Imo West Senator and former Governor, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Rochas Okorocha</strong></a> as an individual who gives him headaches because he fails to realize he is no longer in charge of the state.</p><p>“We have many former governors in the state. We have former governors Achike Udenwa, Ikedi Ohakim, Emeka Ihedioha and Rochas Okorocha. But Rochas Okorocha has failed to recognize that he is a former governor</p><p>“Rochas Okorocha is my younger brother. I am older than him and today I am the governor. He should recognize that fact and accord me that respect,” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye49tZqKln2K8rLvRqJqhmV2ewG652GawqK2enLKzecGrpq2glad6tK3YrGSusp%2BZtq%2B5wGaYrGWYmnqnrcilqmasn2K7ornEZqueqqKkv6q%2FzGaqqaeeqLyzv4yipWasmJp6tMDArZxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
