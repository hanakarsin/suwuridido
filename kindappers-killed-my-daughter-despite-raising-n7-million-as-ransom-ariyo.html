On Sunday evening, the 7th of January 2024, around 7:30 pm, a band of kidnappers dressed in full military camo invaded my home located at Sagwari Layout Estate in Dutse, Abuja.</p><p>“They kidnapped my wife (who is also a lawyer) and our four children. The kidnappers called and demanded a 60 million ransom, out of which, through generous donations from friends and family, I was able to raise N7m, which they have refused to collect.</p><p>“As of today, they’ve killed my first born – Michelle Ariyo (13) and dumped her corpse on Kaduna Road, while threatening to kill my three remaining children (all minors) and wife who are still in captivity. Please, and please, sir, I urgently need the intervention of the NBA. When will these kidnappings end? When will the government pretend to be serious about this insecurity in our country? God help us all.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5BwZqShnpmusbzEq6pmo5mhuaawjKawZpyRqrSpwMSrZJ2do6W2tbGMq5iiq5mjtG66lmakoqScnryvecCsZKuZnqi8rnnAq6Cyp18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
