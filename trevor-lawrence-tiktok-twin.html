Source: InstagramClemson may have lost the Football National Championship to LSU on Jan. 13, but the university‚Äôs quarterback, Trevor Lawrence, can still crack a smile thanks to his TikTok lookalike.
Back in November, a 16-year-old girl from Georgia went viral on the video-sharing app for hilariously (and very accurately) imitating the longhaired athlete. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve learned about Trevor‚Äôs doppelg√§nger."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve learned about Trevor‚Äôs doppelg√§nger.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Trevor Lawrence‚Äôs TikTok twin?</h2><p>High schooler Bella Martina now boasts over 99K followers on the social media platform because of her resemblance to the 20-year-old, but the teen confessed that she wasn‚Äôt the first one to pick up on the duo‚Äôs similarities.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@bellamartinaaaa href=#>@bellamartinaaaa</a><p>they call me qb</p><a title="‚ô¨ Crew (feat. Brent Faiyaz & Shy Glizzy) - GoldLink" href=#>‚ô¨ Crew (feat. Brent Faiyaz & Shy Glizzy) - GoldLink</a></figure><p>"[My friend] taps me and he‚Äôs like, 'My brother just said you look like Trevor Lawrence,'" Martina recalled in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Athletic</a>. "I was like, 'What?! I look like Trevor?' and they‚Äôre all going 'Yeah, yeah,' and so then we started showing everybody in the class. They were all like‚Ä¶ 'You have to do a side-by-side.'"</p><p>Naturally, the video found its way to Lawrence, who admitted that the comparison was uncanny. "That one girl actually does look a lot like me so it‚Äôs kind of crazy. But it‚Äôs funny," the 2019 MVP said.</p><p>When asked what she would do if she ever met the player, Martina replied, "I don‚Äôt know what I would say to him because I don‚Äôt know how he would react. I‚Äôd be like, 'Hi! My name is Bella. You‚Äôve seen my TikToks. We have the same face.' I‚Äôd be so overwhelmed. I might just squeal."</p><p>The pair eventually crossed paths when Clemson played Wake Forest University on Nov. 16. Martina was waiting as Lawrence stepped off the bus with his team, and they snapped a picture together ‚Äî much to the delight of the crowd around them. "Imagine if they get married," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one fan commented</a> on the image.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@clemsonfb href=#>@clemsonfb</a><p>Looks kind of familiar ü§î <a title=duet href=#>#duet</a> <a title=clemson href=#>#clemson</a> <a title=collegefootball href=#>#collegefootball</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a> <a title=trevorlawrence href=#>#trevorlawrence</a> <a title=tailgateszn href=#>#tailgateszn</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Crew (feat.

"Trevor! Trevor lookalike!" he can be heard saying before asking, "Can you throw like him?" We‚Äôd love to see these two in an Adidas ad together.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bella Martina has also been compared to actress Ava Michelle.</h2><p>The internet celeb joked that she‚Äôs the love child of Lawrence and the <a href=#>Tall Girl</a> star, who‚Äôs 6‚Äô1‚Äù. Martina made the connection as part of the popular "My Mom Met My Dad" trend on TikTok in which users pick two celebrities they resemble to be their "parents."</p><p>The audio that accompanies the video was created by TikTok user @steeerling and mocks those clich√© introductions you typically hear at the beginning of teen movies: "It all started when my mom met my dad and they fell in love and they had me. Hi, I'm Ryan, and my life is kinda crazy."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@bellamartinaaaa href=#>@bellamartinaaaa</a><p>when men‚Äôs size 13 nikes meets sunshine</p><a title="‚ô¨ This is my family - steeerling" href=#>‚ô¨ This is my family - steeerling</a></figure><p>"When men‚Äôs size 13 Nikes meets sunshine," Martina captioned her version of the meme, most likely referring to the beloved Remember the Titans character who famously sported long hair like Lawrence.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Martina gained a following due to her impressions of the all star, it sounds like she‚Äôs ready to retire the bit. "OK I promise I‚Äôm done stealing this man‚Äôs identity," she wrote next to one video.</p><p>We‚Äôve never been so bummed that college football season is over!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqb%2Bmws6rZKWZp6eyr6%2FEZquio6SkuG7A1qKl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
