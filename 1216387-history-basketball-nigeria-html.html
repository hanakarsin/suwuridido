The country was under British rule at those times. There was no national team or basketball federation, but young people who learned about the popular American ‘bball’ game and had a big desire to play it got a chance to be trained.</p><p class=align-left>The first man who became a basketball trainer in our country was Walid Zabadne. So, we can say that it was he who brought basketball to Nigeria and began an interesting history of this game in our country.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c9b8201e5cda9f7c_w.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Emmanuel Anibaba: Meet the Nigerian from Kogi state playing for UK rugby team</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> History of football in Nigeria</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c9b8201e5cda9f7c_w.jpg><p class=align-left>Photo: scorum.com</p><h3>History and development of basketball in Nigeria</h3><p class=align-left>Mr. Walid Zabadne was a trainer in a Syrian club.
