Recall, Tolanibaj sparked reactions on social media earlier in the year after she wrote on X that she does not like the sight of men dancing in clubs. According to her, only broke men do such.
In April, she clarified that it was okay for men to dance in clubs, but they shouldn’t be the centre of attention."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

There’s a tweet that I remember that actually got my attention out there before I came into the house. She was like ‘If a boy is in the club and he is dancing he is broke but if a guy is in the club and he’s standing in one place he has money. I just laugh say ‘who be ds one?’”</p><p class=p1>The 42-year-old also said he cannot cook for a lot of people.</p><p class=p1>“I can’t explain to them that I cannot cook for a lot of people, I don’t know how to do it. Not because I’m scared only that they’ll laugh at me that my cooking is not nice, but at the same time I can cook what I can eat,” he said.</p><p class=p1>“The other day Adekunle came here, he was like God bless those people wey dey cook for the whole house o. I felt bad because I was cooking for myself. This boy since I come this house I never see am cook for anybody pass Venita. Na pepper he dey cut since, pepper and onions.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e5JqZpuanpa2q62MmqOlZaOprrO%2FjK2mpZmenq%2Bitoykpaibm5qxbq3GmqCnZZ%2BrsrN5waumpJ1dorKvedKtmK2dnZq7tXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
