These cases were already in court and that there would be a forensic investigation to confirm whether there was actually a forgery.</p><p>“The internal mechanism is going to be an investigation within the party. And the investigation within the party will give us the opportunity to come out and publicize what we’re doing to confirm whether there was a forgery or not. That also takes us to the issue of the police. This particular case is still in the court.</p><p>“We started an investigation immediately after the issues were raised, which was some couple of months ago. But the problem is that before we could deal with one issue, they came up with another issue. So we feel like it’s a choreographed and a calculated attempt to bring disdain and disrespect to the party. And if you notice it, the trend is going gradually.</p><p>“However, at every point in time, the national working committee will come out with a statement as regards every allegation that has been made against the chairman.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FrZqWZkqTCs3nPmqmtsV2ovaatyqxkqKZdm7%2BiwcNmnaiql5q%2FunnApaOen5GptrC60maYoJmZo8C1ecCbrKudXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
