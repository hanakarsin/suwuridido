According to rapper Megan Thee Stallion, it's about men and women being unapologetically themselves.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>By this point, you've probably heard many a woman, man, and brand proclaim they're going to have a "hot girl summer." But what is a hot girl summer? According to <a href=#>Megan Thee Stallion</a>, the rapper who brought the phrase to its present popularity, a hot girl summer can be pretty much whatever you want it to be... as long as you own it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where did "hot girl summer" start?</h2><p>Megan Thee Stallion, who often refers to herself as "Hot Girl Meg," had a song on her 2018 album Tina Snow called "Hot Girl." She used the phrase again the lyrics of "Cash S--t," a breakout track from her newest album, Fever (released in May 2019).&nbsp;</p><p>From there, the "real hot girl s--t" line started a movement. Hot Girl Meg and her music became the soundtrack for everyone wanting to have a #HotGirlSummer.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So what is a "hot girl summer," really?</h2><p>"It’s just basically about women — and men — just being unapologetically them," Megan Thee Stallion told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Root</a>. "Just having a good-ass time, hyping up your friends, doing you, not giving a damn about what nobody got to say about it...You definitely have to be a person that can be the life of the party, and, y’know, just a bad b---h."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>As Hot Girl Meg told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a>, "A Hot Girl exudes self-love and self-confidence...A Hot Girl is somebody who's super confident; somebody that's just unapologetically them. A sassy attitude and doesn't care what nobody has to say about them."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What's with all the "hot girl summer" memes?!</h2><p>Like many a meme, the #hotgirlsummer trend started off somewhat organically. Megan Thee Stallion's fans — aka her "hotties" — began posting fun, seasonal selfies with the #hotgirlsummer hashtag. Celebrities like <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jada Pinkett Smith</a> got in on the hot girl summer fun, too.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>It didn't take long, though, for influencers and corporations alike to starting trying to cash in on the trend. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maybelline</a> borrowed the phrase for a brand-friendly tweet, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wendy's</a> dubbed their lemonade "the official drink of Hot Girl Summer."&nbsp;</p><p>Forever 21 went so far as to use a variation of the phrase in a promotional newsletter.&nbsp;When Megan Thee Rapper was made aware of Forever 21's "Feeling' Hot Girl SUMMAH!" newsletter subject line," she playfully blasted it on Twitter. "Not 'summah,'" she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>, adding three crying-with-laughter emojis.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>LONDON HOTTIES RSVP NOW TO THE FIRST EVER LONDON HOTTIE PARTY!

And just like "big d--k energy" was the go-to slang for all summer 2018, "hot girl summer" will be trendy well into the fall.&nbsp;</p><p>Funnily enough, Megan Thee Stallion doesn't actually have a "hot girl summer" lyric in any her songs, but the rapper plans to change that.&nbsp;</p><p>She just posted a pretty big tease to Twitter, writing Wednesday, "I feel like it’s only right I drop a hot girl summer song before the summer is over." That seems like something we can all get behind. And in the meantime, everyone carry on with your hot girl/hot boy summer.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyiqmaZXZ28tXnGoqmlZaOquq6x0Q%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
