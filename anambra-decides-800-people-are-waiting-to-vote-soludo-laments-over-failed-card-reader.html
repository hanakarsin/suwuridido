There are also many polling units without INEC officials.</p><p>“Two fundamental things are there’s a complete failure of the card reader. It takes 20 minutes sometimes to accredit a voter. I’ve been here for 20 minutes waiting for INEC to fix things.</p><p>“We are getting complaints all over the state. By 12:30 voting is yet to start at my polling unit and we haven’t started voting. The experts have failed.</p><p>“This raises fundamental questions about technology. I’m shocked about the glitches and the fact that people are not allowed to vote. INEC needs to fix the technology. We’ve not even started and it’s almost 1 pm so what time will the voting stop for the credibility of this process?</p><p>“In Ihiala, materials have not even left the local government but I’m calm and will be optimistic.</p><p>“The second thing is the inadequacy of INEC staff to be punctual at the polling units. There are no policemen here which is the problem in some areas of the state.”</p><p>Soludo, pleaded with his supporters at the polling unit to be patient till the Independent National Electoral Commission resolves the issue so that they can vote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye49vZpqmkaKvs62MnZycoZSawG6Ej2lkqZ2fpbmmecCrnGavkZ7BqrrGZquoZaakwaZ50qijrpyfYrmiucSnq6xln6uys3nFmqClnZRisKK%2Bw2apnpmUmr9w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
