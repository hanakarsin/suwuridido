Source: Getty ImagesReality television can get a little dramatic and over the top. That’s a big reason why The Great American Baking Show and its parent series, The Great British Bake-Off (called the Great British Baking Show in the U.S.) are such breaths of fresh air. Seriously, the biggest nail-biter in a given episode is whether the judge will shake somebody’s hand in approval."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That’s a big reason why The Great American Baking Show and its parent series, <a href=#>The Great British Bake-Off</a> (called the Great British Baking Show in the U.S.) are such breaths of fresh air. Seriously, the biggest nail-biter in a given episode is whether the judge will shake somebody’s hand in approval. The show's low-stakes nature is especially ironic given the on-again-off-again saga of head judge Paul Hollywood and his ex-wife, Alex.</p><p>Seriously, buckle in, this story has some twists and turns.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">So, did Paul Hollywood have an affair?</h2><p>Paul and Alexandra Hollywood had been fairly regular tabloid fodder across the pond prior to their separation in 2017. The couple had a very public separation, reconciliation, and re-separation, after all — but the sordid story is probably less familiar with American fans.&nbsp;</p><p>Funnily enough, the reason they split was Paul’s affair with his former American co-host Marcela Valladolid, which he admitted to in a candid <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>2013 interview with BBC Radio 5</u></a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>"It was the biggest mistake of my life,” he said of the affair, "because actually I still love my wife... we are talking, working together, but it's going to take time."</p><p>He was also taken aback by the public attention on his personal life. "I was shocked about the whole thing kicking off the way it did... but I deserved it and I've taken it. It was my punishment," he said at the time.</p><p>Seems Paul didn’t learn from the “biggest mistake of his life,” though.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Are Paul Hollywood and his wife back together?</h2><p>That's a big nope. Though they reconciled briefly, Paul, who was 52 at the time, had another affair, this time with 20-something pub server Summer Monteys-Fullam. There was actually some pretty A+ shade on Alex's Instagram shortly after the news became public.&nbsp;</p><p>A cook in her own right with some bestselling cookbooks under her belt, Alex shared an Instagram post about her “Easy Summer Berry Tart” recipe that was pretty well-timed with the news of her ex’s dalliances.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Paul and the young waitress denied that their relationship began before he and Alex called it quits (again), but the baker's estranged wife had a different story to tell. She reportedly named Summer in her divorce filing and cited "adultery" as the cause of the split.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Paul Hollywood and his wife Alex officially divorced in 2019.</h2><p>Although they had been estranged for years — since 2017, actually — Paul and Alex didn't make their divorce official until 2019. The estranged couple were<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> granted a divorce on July 19, 2019</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Paul Hollywood dating now?</h2><p>Paul's relationship with Summer reportedly ended in August 2019, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>. Not long afterward — in late 2019/early 2020 — he was reportedly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">romantically connected to Melissa Spalding</a>, who is his local pub landlady.</p><p>A spokesman for Paul told the Daily Mail in December 2019 that "they are very happily together."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpa62uIyhpqWkqay8sLCMsKCfnV2Ztre70ZycZpmWm66qvg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
