But to users on the app, he's this fun little dude who loves to hang out and dance. He can often be spotted donning his signature reddish-orange onesie and vibing out to his favorite song â€œFeel No Ways" by <a href=#>Drake</a>. But worry not, Horace is down to groove to just about any tune. He's the definition of low-key.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@tina_042 href=#>@tina_042</a><p><a title=fypã‚· href=#>#fypã‚·</a> <a title=funny href=#>#funny</a></p><a title="â™¬ Feel No Ways - Drake" href=#>â™¬ Feel No Ways - Drake</a></figure><p>He is also the star of thousands of videos on TikTok.

An older man who previously modeled for one of Gray's undergraduate sculpting classes had actually become the inspo behind Horace. See the original Horace below.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by JACKSON Q. GRAY (@jqgray)</a></p></figure><p>Horace originally was designed naked, as Horace saw him as a "tragic character" who was growing old and was "in his own world."</p><p>After a few more tweaks, Gray manifested a more interactive version of Horace, which he unveiled on Facebook come May 2020. However, it was only a week before Horace was taken down for containing "content of an adult or sexual nature."</p><p>Horace was too good of a character to just trash. So Gray created a new version of Horace (fully clothed) with a unique backstory that nods to anticensorship laws. In Gray's video below of Horace's rebirth, he nodded to the fact that Facebook killed Horace off â€” but Horace cannot ever be silenced. Now a newer, better version of Horace was born and ready to take over.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by JACKSON Q.

Luckily, Gray didn't have to do much to get eyes on his creation. Naturally, Horace was a star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnbyzrcKeZK2hm6m8rHnFoqOtnaI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
