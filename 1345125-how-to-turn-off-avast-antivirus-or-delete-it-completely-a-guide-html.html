You can use any of these two methods - the first one can be done through the system tray, while for the second one, you will need to perform some actions in the settings.</p><p class=align-left>You can disable Avast using the first method by doing the following:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f2ae5fe4daac1e76.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to play on bet365 - The best tutorial for beginners</span></p></a><ul><li>First of all, you need to right-click on the Avast icon on the system tray. It is in the bottom right corner of your screen.</li><li>Once you have done this, you will see a menu with a few options. Choose "Avast shields control" and there will be some disabling choices.</li><li>You can disable your antivirus program for 10 minutes, one hour, until the next restart, or permanently. Pick the option that suits you best.</li><li>After that, you will need to confirm whether you really want to perform this action. This is done because sometimes malware programs attempt to turn off Avast without the user's knowledge, so by picking "yes", you will confirm that you are doing this intentionally.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f2ae5fe4daac1e76.jpg><p class=align-left>There is also another way that you can use if you want to know how to turn Avast off for some time. You can do this from the program's settings menu:</p><ul><li>Open the Avast main window. There are two ways to do so - you can double-click either on the desktop icon or the system tray icon.</li><li>Once the window is open, launch Settings. You will find the settings menu in the bottom left corner of the window.</li><li>You will see a few tabs, one of which will be the Components tab. Click on it to open.</li><li>Some of the security components will be the file system, behavior, mail, and web shields. You will need to disable some of them - particularly the file system, mail, and web shields.</li><li>If the previous step was successful, the status of the particular shields that you have disabled will change to "off". If you want to turn it back on, you should just tap the same button and it will become green again, with the message <i>"You are protected".</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/008a982bfe9f8bcf.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>35 best Tinder openers nobody will ever dare to swipe left on</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The work is done, and now you know how to disable Avast Antivirus and how to turn off Avast web shield.
