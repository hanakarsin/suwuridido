This is certainly a first for the Below Deck franchise since there’s never been a case of a guest not tipping the crew after a charter that seemed to go relatively well.&nbsp;</p><p>But is this really what went down?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does the 'Below Deck Med' crew get stiffed on their tip?</h2><p>Viewers were shocked when previews for the Sept. 21episode show the primary guest, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathan “JT” DePaz</a> standing on the dock and handing out what appear to be dinner gift cards to the crew as they bid him and his guests farewell. Jonathan is also heard saying that he knows the crew “normally get[s] a tip” but he thought it would be just as good to give them “dinner invites.”</p><p>“I’ll see ya,” Jonathan says to the crew as they all do their best to remain professional while he walks off the dock. While guests have been known to leave meager tips in the past, this is the first time a guest on Below Deck has left no tip at all, other than in Season 1 when the guests were escorted off the boat because they were busted for bringing drugs on board.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>@alexradcliffe : “Hey Bugs, what’s the theme?” @bugsydrake : “I dunno...

A customary mega-yacht tip is about 5% to 30% of the charter base fee depending on the quality of the service guests receive over the course of their two- to three-day yacht adventure.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Karolina Wojtasik/Bravo</span></figure><p>On Below Deck, tips are not included in the base price of chartering the yacht, which for this season’s vessel, is $243,000 a week. But while guests on the Bravo reality show do get a discount on the listed price for The Wellington mega-yacht, they are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">expected to tip</a>&nbsp;based on the undiscounted rate.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the show’s many seasons, guests have been known to tip anywhere from $15,000 to $30,000 and it’s not uncommon for individual crew members to walk away with $2,000 per charter. However, for a boat that’s the size and price of The Wellington, the tip works out to around $36,537 to $73,146, the highest audiences have seen over the course of the show’s 12 seasons.&nbsp;</p><p>Catch new episodes of Below Deck Med, Mondays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7Ktu9Zmm56bm2K6prCMp6ZmrJml</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
