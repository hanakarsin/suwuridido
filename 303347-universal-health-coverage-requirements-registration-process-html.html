This means that the majority of the population are poor and cannot afford to pay for the expensive medical covers per month. A recent report by the World Bank revealed that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">only 20% </a>of Kenyans have medical insurance services. Below is everything you need to know about the Universal Health Coverage initiative.</p><h2>Universal Health Coverage meaning</h2><p class=align-left>WHO (World Health Organization) defines UHC as a medical cover scheme that does not expose users to financial hardships. Everyone can get preventive, curative, promotive, rehabilitative, and palliative quality health services without having to dig deep into their pockets.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9adf66dc4899b7c8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>New NHIF rates for employees and the self employed in 2024</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In summary:</p><ul><li>Who does it cover? All citizens inclusive of the most vulnerable and also poor</li><li>What is it about? Facilitation of essential health services.</li><li>How is it achieved? Through the reduction of expenses (risk pooling)</li></ul><h2>Requirements for UHC registration</h2><p class=align-left>To enrol in this initiative, you must fulfil the following requirements:</p><li>Be a Kenyan.</li><li>Have a national ID</li><li>Pay contributions. This answers the question, “Is Universal Health Coverage free?” However, in some <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">counties like Makueni</a>, the charges usually are as low as Ksh. 500 per year per household.</li><li>Covered children must be under the age of 18 years. If students, then they must be below 24 years.</li><li>You must be from the respective county.</li><h2>Universal Health Coverage registration process</h2><p class=align-left>UHC registration is free. You don’t pay anything extra apart from the yearly contributions.</p><li>Visit any NHIF (National Hospital Fund) branch countrywide.</li><li>Ensure that you have your National ID intact.</li><li>For dependents, carry their passports, birth certificates or national IDs.</li><li>Fill in a form that will be given to you.</li><li>Pay the yearly contributions if any as you wait for your UHC card to be printed.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5c7e625a7a301ec1.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenya Airways recruitment portal - Vacancies and application guide</span></p></a><p class=align-left>To access NHIF Universal Health Coverage services, you must produce your UHC card.

They include the following:</p><li>Equality in health service access: It ensures that everyone, regardless of his/her financial status, can get numerous services including the ones who cannot afford.</li><li>Quality services: It ensures that services received are excellent such that the wellbeing of the recipients is drastically improved.</li><li>Protection against financial risk: It also makes sure that the cost of accessing the initiative does not overburden beneficiaries.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9adf66dc4899b7c8.jpeg><h2>Pillars of Universal Health Coverage</h2><p class=align-left>UHC has the following guiding principles:</p><ul><li>Universality as one of the components of Universal Health Coverage.

During that year, Universal Health Coverage in counties will have been rolled out nationally.</p><p class=align-left>The national government, the World Bank which has contributed <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ksh 2 billion</a>, and other development partners have funded this pilot program. County governments will be required to pay their community workers for any service they provide within the boundaries of the counties.</p><h2>Challenges Universal Health Coverage is set to encounter</h2><p class=align-left>UHC will cover medical bills in public hospitals only. Not all public hospitals are well equipped. Some lack even the most basic amenities such as electricity, water, and enough beds.</p><p class=align-left>Other shortcomings may result from time to time doctor or nurses strikes that paralyse treatment and threaten the success of the program. Availability of a few staff members results in congestion and slow service delivery in most hospitals.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/48af6c479fcca988.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best courses for B+, B, or B- students in 2024 (KUCCPS)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Most public facilities cannot treat some ailments such as cancer. This forces them to refer patients to private hospitals. Since the scheme doesn’t cover treatment in private hospitals, patients may pay huge amounts of money to get treated.</p><p class=align-left>As usual, rampant embezzlement of funds and corruption is another drawback to the program. For instance, more than Ksh. 50 billion was lost mysteriously through corruption in NHIF. UHC is not different from NHIF, so money can still be stolen.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Amref University gets full accreditation to operate in Kenya</p><h2>Previous programs similar to Universal Health Coverage</h2><p class=align-left>In 2014, with the support of the World Bank Group, UK Aid, and Gates Foundation, the government of Kenya started a collaborative HISP (Health Insurance Subsidy Programme). The initiative aimed at extending financial risk protection to the most impoverished families through subsidies. The program was expected to cover both inpatient and outpatient services but never succeeded.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a011a9e3751f36d6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>NHIF dependent registration process 2020</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Universal Health Coverage undoubtedly is one of the essential projects initiated by the president under the Big Four Agenda.
