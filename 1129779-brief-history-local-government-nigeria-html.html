To bring the model of democratic self- governance and facilitate the leadership potential of Nigerians on local levels.</p><p class=align-left>3. To gather human and material resources and involve them in their local government. It is important to provide a two-way channel of communication between both state and local governments.</p><h2>The beginning of local governments in Nigeria</h2><p class=align-left>A long time ago, Nigeria was ruled by the colonial government and the local government was called the Administration system or Native Authority.</p><p class=align-left>It was a system consisting of unconditional colonial ruling classes or “<i>traditional institutions of chiefs and other traditional rulers of the natives under the supervision of British Administrative Officer</i>”. But this kind of local government system was not sufficient because it consisted of only chiefs and rulers. There was no chance for local people to be elected or to have their voice heard. It is obvious that not everything was perfect in the system of local administration, and at that time the existing governing structure was only the remains of colonialism.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt1epld239euf.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 important Nigerian historical facts every citizen should know</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4q1gj2u35h2.jpg><p class=align-left>However, the leaders decided to create a new system which would suit the interest of local people but kept failing at achieving this or satisfying the interest of the people. For example, the Native Authority leaders were expected to be able to levy and collect tax for the salaries of the chiefs and other officials and services of the authorities, but not all local communities got accustomed to this new rule, therefore they also had their own traditional ways of carrying out such services.</p><p class=align-left>In short, the lack of Western education and modern approach to the ruling made the governance insufficient. The Native Authority system did not belong to legislators, executives or administrators systems. All rulers were just administrative couriers for the colonial officers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/08bf01ed4549c84f.jpg><h2>Sole native local government autonomy in Nigeria</h2><p class=align-left>In 1946, the system of local government in Nigeria was changed to the Sole Native Authority System. As the Sole Native Authority System was put in action, Egba women all expressed their disgust, saying that this type of Sole Native Authority System hastened the marginalization of women and increased the gender imbalance in governing system.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e57cb778dae8dff9.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The three arms of government in Nigeria and their functions</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In an attempt to defend the Sole Native Authority system’s principles, in 1947, the last colonial Secretary of State, Lord Creech-Jones stated: “The key to resolving the problems of African administration lay in the development of an efficient and democratic system of local government.”</p><h2>The Nigerian constitution adopted in 1979</h2><p class=align-left>The reform implemented in 1976 and Nigerian constitution adopted in 1979 were still unable to solve the problem of traditional ruling in Nigeria. The financial instability and fragility of local government councils loosened their power and various functions performed by them. There were some cases where locals did not even know the councilors of local government councils when election time came up.</p><p class=align-left>The local governmental structure in Nigeria suffered from various issues, which held back the local governments’ development.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt1epld239euf.jpg><p class=align-left>The 1979 - 1983 phase of the fight for the local government administration system in Nigeria was quite productive. The state government tried to manage local government councils on spot but in fact, they only fought for the authority and influence of the local government councils. Moreover, some states even created a couple of local councils within the state.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt70to09cmvlf.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Most Interesting facts from the history of Nigerian National Youth Service Corps</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Buhari Administration was launched in December 1983 and lasted till August 1985. During the implementation of the Buhari program, the administration cut down the number of local government from 770 to 301. These 301 local councils were approved and defined by the Constitution. Although everything looked perfect on paper, the system did not work properly in reality. As a result of some inadequacies in the system, in 1984 the Federal Military Government organized the Government Review Committee with Alhaji Ibrahim Dasuki responsible for the investigation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7lmv6tnc6ft.jpg><p class=align-left>The Dasuki Report confirmed that the problem of local governments had been inherited from the 1976 local government reforms. The behavior and attitude of ruling officials did not change; therefore there was no system drawback, the failure was as a result of personal factors.</p><p class=align-left>In 1986, the responsibility of deployment and employment of local government staff was handed to ministries of local government. As a result, the new local democracy tendencies started and the old attitude was dropped. However, even though the local government structure still existed, the federal government controlled the basis of local governments.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2k535l92e35g.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 6 reasons why Nigeria adopted federalism</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt16idncbsr1d8.jpg><p class=align-left>As at 1987, the cooperation between the states and local governments was still very tense. There was a need to enhance both citizenship participation and local level service; to achieve this, in March 1988, the federal government adopted some comprehensive reforms which aimed to reform the local government’s structure, finance and administration systems radically. These radical reforms helped to change the local government councils into effective centers of local development.</p><p class=align-left>Despite the hope of brilliant development, the federal government suffered some failures. More states and local governments got created in 1987, but this resulted in structural changes in some communities and a refusal to support the new local councils.</p><h2>The 1999 Constitution and local governments</h2><p class=align-left>In the last three decades, so many reforms have been adopted to make the local government systems better. Although there were some failures in the process of reforming the structure and functions of local governments, it still led to amazing changes in the entire system.

The recognition of local government in Nigeria at the third tier level of government was enshrined in the 1989 and 1995 Constitutions. Just like the Constitution of 1979, the 1999 Constitution addressed important issues, such as the problem of local government system, the creation of new local governments, adjustments in the system and functions of local governments, public officials’ code of conduct, funding and financial support of local governments, and, finally, a list of local governments.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt11koja3jlob.jpg><p class=align-left>Presently Nigeria is divided into 36 states with one federal capital territory. These Nigerian states are also subdivided into 774 local government areas. These areas reflect the local development of the Nigerian federative system; the adoption of this federative system contributed to the distribution of authority on the local level. The local government areas have exact responsibilities, such as births or deaths registration, registration of marriages or divorces, maintenance or construction of roads, the collection of taxes and maintenance of public transport. The local government councils is a very democratic legislative body but still very connected to the federal government.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt6f1blheti15.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Three tiers of Nigerian government and the ☑ relationship between them</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>History of entrepreneurship in Nigeria</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnJ%2BmHBucmWSp7amsoyhoKysn6fGbrjOnJilZZekw6a%2Bzaacp6xdo7aosdGimGegpKK5</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
