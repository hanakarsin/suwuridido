[article_adwert]
The group has been agitating for an independent Biafra state and its members have staged several protests calling for a break away from Nigeria.
As against the call by the Ethnic Nationalities of the South-South which dissociated from Biafra, MASSOB has come out to claim that all Niger Delta areas and the former eastern region are part of Biafra."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

These are Biafran territories. Biafra encompasses all the states of the former Eastern region, including Anioma clan in Delta state. It has been part of the Federal government’s divide and rule policy to tell the World that only Ndigbo want Biafra; but this is false. Do you remember Ojukwu’s second in command, Philip Effiong? Was he not from Akwa Ibom? When he was here, can anybody doubt his commitment to the actualization of Biafra?</i></p><p><i>“If you see the kind of support from the local people of Ugep, Ikom, Ogoja and adjoining areas when we held our meeting there last week at Ugep, you will be shocked. Over 2,000 people registered as MASSOB members at that meeting. In fact, from what we saw at the meeting, the people of Ogoja, Ugep and Ikom are more Biafra than even Ndigbo.”</i></p><p>He said the continued detention of Nnamdi Kanu, despite court orders calling for his release was a testament of the marginalization of the Igbo people.</p><p>He said: <i>“Nnamdi Kanu is from Eastern Nigeria; this is why he is being held despite court order. His detention is part of the larger plot to continue to marginalize our people and frustrate Biafra, but we can never be deterred. Biafra is the answer,”</i></p><p>Meanwhile, the Itsekiri people in Warri, Delta state dissociated themselves from the call and agitation of some Igbo people in the south east for an independent state of Biafra.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3iEl21uZpqZlrOzrYymmKyrn5d6rbHAnZyrZZ2WuKa%2FjKecsGWkmr%2BztdOoqaKZnGKxpq%2FLmqmarJmku2%2B006aj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
