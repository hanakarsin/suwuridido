In football, you cannot predict what might happen against Equatorial Guinea and Guinea Bissau.</p><p>“There has been a development from these two teams in recent years. They have players in European teams. Of course, the chances of Ivory Coast and Nigeria are stronger, but they must prove their ability to qualify by winning.”</p><p>The Super Eagles will begin their 2023 AFCON campaign against Equatorial Guinea on January 14. They will take on Ivory Coast on January 18 and Guinea Bissau on January 22 to end their Group A campaign.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye49uZp6lnZa7trHLZpimrZ6euKZ51pqpp6tdqMKxsdFmnJqfnJrAbq3HnpidZZ%2BbenN8kWxkmp6TpLtw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
