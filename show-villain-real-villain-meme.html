Occasionally, a show will paint one character as a villain, but time and wisdom will reveal that the real villain was someone else all along."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Occasionally, a show will paint one character as a villain, but time and wisdom will reveal that the real villain was someone else all along. Here are our favorite show villain vs. real villain examples out there.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Game of Thrones'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>If you slogged through the last season of Game of Thrones with the rest of us, it has to be clear to you that the Night King was just doing what he thought was best for his people. Showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss on the other hand, well, they ruined everything.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Scream 3'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>I know it was the year 2000, but there is absolutely no excuse for Courteney Cox's baby bangs in Scream 3. Ghostface may pop up out of nowhere with a knife and stab you to death, but those baby bangs will haunt your nightmares forever.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Harry Potter'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>A sad but true fact. <a href=#>J.K. Rowling continues to push harmful anti-trans beliefs</a> and prove that she is the actual villain of the Harry Potter world. Voldemort has nothing on this woman causing real-life harm.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Home Alone 2: Lost in New York'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Ah yes, time has made it clear that the real villains of Home Alone 2: Lost in New York aren't the two movie criminals. Donald Trump is so villainous that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Canadian TV actually cut this scene out of the movie</a> when they aired it!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'The Devil Wears Prada'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>It seems that every few months, the internet rediscovers that the "true" villain of The Devil Wears Prada isn't Miranda Priestly, Andy's overbearing, abusive boss, but her boyfriend who wants her to stop following her dreams because she seems extremely unhappy all the time and is changing her entire self right before his eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>In case you can't tell, I have a teensy bit of sympathy for the guy. I think there's nuance there, and there's probably a middle ground he could have struck in still supporting her, but if you think Miranda isn't also a villain, you're living in a fantasy world. Which brings me to the next one...</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'The Devil Wears Prada' (Again!)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>It's gotten to the point where people who "ACTUALLY" other people about the villain of The Devil Wears Prada are the actual villains of the movie. Let's all just step away from this one for a while and move on.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Gilmore Girls'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>In recent rewatchings, it becomes clear that Emily Gilmore isn't the heartless villain we all thought she was when Gilmore Girls was on air. Sure, she's racist and stubborn and has the potential for cruelty, but she's also strong and ultimately cares a lot about her daughter and granddaughter. Luke's long-lost daughter April Nardini, on the other hand, has in time been branded an evil force, one that completely ruined the show.</p><p>But I'm going to lay down some truth right now. Are you ready for this? You don't hate April Nardini. You hate what April did to Luke and Lorelai. And that's no one's fault but Luke's and Lorelai's. April is innocent. Justice for April Nardini!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Breaking Bad'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>I share this one not because I agree with it but because it's so wildly out of touch. Skyler White's husband lied to her and lived a double life as a drug lord and people got mad because she was upset??? Actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna Gunn got extreme, unwarranted backlash for the Skyler character</a> during the run of the show. If you want to make this one accurate, reverse it! What Walter White did to his family is unforgivable.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Breaking Bad' (Again!)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Of course, a show like Breaking Bad would have never existed if the United States health care system wasn't so broken from the inside out. The whole premise of the show — a chemistry teacher starts cooking meth to make sure his family isn't driven into insane debt because of his illness — would be moot in a country with universal health care.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Us'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Finally, spoilers for Us ahead! The Tethered are painted as the movie's villains. After all, they come up from the pipes to terrorize and murder the families that look just like them.&nbsp;</p><p>But in the final moments of the movie, you realize that when Adelaide faced her Tethered years ago, as a child, and her Tethered switched places with her! The "real" Adelaide has been living underground for almost her entire life, croaking and running into walls. Of course, the true villains in Us, if you look a little deeper, are the American class system, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">capitalism, privilege</a>, and racism!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLWww4yvoKWkkZ67br7EmqNmrpmhuaK1zWaknqWV</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
