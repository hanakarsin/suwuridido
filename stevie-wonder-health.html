The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Detroit Free Press</a> spoke about the singer's issues in 2019 with musician Joan Belgrave, a friend of Stevie's for years. Joan said: "He’s got some health challenges, but he doesn’t want a big PR thing out of this. He’s in great spirits. You would never know anything is going on. That’s how he wants it, and that’s how he wants to keep it."</p><p>A source also suggested at the time that Stevie was still fulfilling all of his performance obligations, but was touring with a team of medical professionals.</p><p>Rumors surfaced in 2019 that Stevie was suffering kidney failure and began dialysis, but his rep told Detroit Free Press at the time that "nothing is verified unless it comes directly from us."</p><p>That very same year Stevie confirmed he was going to have a kidney transplant during a London concert, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, corroborating the rumors from a year earlier. "So what’s gonna happen is this: I’m going to have surgery. I’m going to have a kidney transplant in September of this year," he told fans at the show, adding, "You ain’t got to hear no rumors about nothing; I told you what’s up — I’m good. I’m all good; I’m all good. I have a donor; it’s all good."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Then, after the procedure, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Express</a>, Stevie explained, "Let everybody know that I was blessed with a new kidney and that happened on Dec. 6, 2019. Since I have been released from the hospital, I’ve had nurses that have made sure I have my medicine on time and I’m going to take it for as long as I have to — even if it’s for the rest of my life."</p><p>He added that the surgery made him feel like he went "from being 70 to being 40. I feel like I’m about 40 right now. I’m feeling great."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Stevie Wonder is gearing up for a performance at a Grammy-helmed Paul Simon tribute concert.</h2><p>The health issues that he faced the last few years aside, Stevie isn't letting anything get in the way of him honoring his longtime friend and fellow musician <a href=#>Paul Simon</a>.
