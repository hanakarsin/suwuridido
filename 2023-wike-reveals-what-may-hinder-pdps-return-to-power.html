Without the party, nobody can be a presidential candidate. There must be a party. So, there is the need for everybody to work together, make the party united before we talk about who will be the presidential candidate.</p><p>“We cannot afford to miss this opportunity that Nigerians are giving back to PDP to take over the government in 2023. Everybody must work together as a party. And as governors, we must work together. If we didn’t work together, we wouldn’t have had the best convention we have ever had as a party.”</p><p>Meanwhile, a former National Publicity Secretary of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chuks Ibegbu, has said it comes to him as a surprise that Nigeria’s Vice President, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Yemi Osinbajo who he considered a man of God</strong></a> would be interested in vying for the 2023 presidency.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that Ibegbu said this while faulting the interest of Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, and Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in becoming the nation’s next leader.</p><p>Ibegbu observed that age is already telling on the likes of Tinubu, Atiku, same as Osinbajo, adding that Nigeria at the moment needs a young and dynamic person who has the energy to move around.</p><p>He charged the three aspirants to kindly pick a credible presidential candidate from the Southeast.</p><p>Recall that Tinubu had disclosed earlier that he had informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his intention to run for the 2023 presidency.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5BqZmtoYmh6uLXKnmSrnaaarq2%2FjLCfmqxdoq66eceipZ2domK9pbzSZqmerKWnu27AzmanqK%2BVp3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
