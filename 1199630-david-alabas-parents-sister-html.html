David Alaba father, George Alaba, is from Nigeria. He has quite an exciting story. George Alaba came to Austria from Nigeria and became a talented and prominent musician, while also doing a lot of other things, like being a serving soldier in the Austrian army.</p><h3>David Alaba's father</h3><p class=align-left>Father of David Alaba was born as a crown prince of the Ogun State, Nigeria – his father was a king. Since his family never lacked anything, the parents of George sent him to study abroad. For their son’s education, the Nigerian royalty couple chose the Austrian city of Vienna.</p><p class=align-left>In 1984, George went overseas to study Economics at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, which was his primary interest at the time.</p><p class=align-left>Later, George understood that Economics is not the right discipline for him. So, he made a decision to drop out of his studies and dive into the musical career. At first, he worked as a DJ at the popular local African club, in front of the audience from various countries and cities. Soon, he started working on his first CD release. When it came out, it became a huge hit in the country, and George Alaba became a nationally famous artist. His great fame helped him become permanent Austrian citizenship in the middle of the 1990’s.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/d90a0f399e9dbd16.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Daddy Yankee net worth and amazing career</span></p></a><p class=align-left>George Alaba decided to pay his loyalty to the country that accepted him so warmly by going to serve at the Armed Forces of Austria. He became the first dark-skinned soldier in the army, which made the news all over Austria and generated a lot of media attention around this man.</p><p class=align-left>After his career in the army, George went back to music, and with great pleasure, he started recording his new tunes. In 1997, he met a fellow singer Petra Suk and with her, he recorded the hit “Indian Song”, which became a national breakthrough and ended up to be the second-ranked song in the Austrian charts.</p><p class=align-left>George Alaba and Petra Suk worked together for seven years. Unfortunately, their close work relationship was over because they had a dispute about naming their band. Seeing how all the other creative differences stand in the way of their collaboration, George Alaba decided to quit working with Petra Suk and returned back to the roots – to his first profession as a DJ. He became a DJ at the local bar “Gogobar Beverly Hills”, which was situated in the city centre of Vienna.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/ca067ba3b1003396.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Get impressed by Martin Lawrence's net worth and top facts about the comedian</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As for George religion, he is a Christian, his entire family are members of Seventh-Day Adventist Church.

She was also an immigrant, like him. She originated from the Philippines but went to Austria to make her dream of becoming a nurse come true. George and Gina instantly hit it off, and later, they got married. Together, they had two wonderful children – the boy David Alaba, and his younger sister Rose May Alaba.</p><p class=align-left>Rose May has made quite a successful career in music, and also tried acting. She also managed to lose 30 kg of weight, which became an inspiration for young Austrians. Her father, George, is very proud that she followed his steps and became a musician.

Their father, George, constantly wanted them to achieve great success, ever since they were very young. So, he encouraged them to start working on their careers when they still were children.</p><h3>Support of the parents in the football career</h3><p class=align-left>As for the older child, David, he did not have the musical talent like his father, but instead, he had a great vision in football. When he was only six years old, his parents registered him at the youth football club “SV Aspern”, which was located in Donaustadt, the Vienna district where the Alaba family lived. His football talent was quickly recognized both by his coaches and parents, and George arranged to transfer his son to the more popular club – “FC Austria Vienna”, where David joined when he was only ten years old in 2002.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/d5ef41f6d92c39e4.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The story of Aliko Dangote education and career success</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Richest footballer in Nigeria team in 2018</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/d90a0f399e9dbd16.jpeg><p class=align-left>Photo: gistmania.com</p><p class=align-left>Through hard work, dedication, and support from his family, David Alaba very quickly moved forward in his youth club career.
