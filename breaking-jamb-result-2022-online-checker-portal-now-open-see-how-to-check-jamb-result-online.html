The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) had announced last weekend the release of the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination( UTME) results, but revealed a different checking method.
Traditionally, UTME results could be accessed via JAMB online results portal, Naija News understands.
