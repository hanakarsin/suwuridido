People were murdered in cold blood and absolutely no iota of justice has been served more than a year after. How can there be peace without justice?</p><p>“In this same speech, you said ‘To be a smart city, we first must be a just one. Remember the young Nigerians that had their lives snatched away by weapons wielded by our own Armed Forces? You want to sweep that under the carpet? Is that how to establish a just city? #ENDSARS</p><p>“Young Nigerians, till today, are still being constantly harassed and extorted by police officers!! You were awfully quiet about that. Or are you not aware? #ENDSARS.”</p><p>Reacting, Mr Marcaroni slammed the governor for inviting some youths for a peace talk instead of talking about making peace.</p><p>The comedian also urged Sanwo-Olu to implement the recommendations of the Lagos judicial panel before talking of genuine peacemaking.</p><p>He said: “I humbly decline the invitation of Mr Governor. The Government themselves set up a panel. The panel has made recommendations.</p><p>“I believe that genuine peacemaking will begin by first implementing the recommendations of the panel. Then we can begin to trust the government.</p><p>“Mr Governor has said it in his speech that to be a Centre of Excellence, we have to be a Center of Truth. Before there can be healing, the government has to be sincere. There must be acceptance of wrongdoings and willingness to correct them.</p><p>“The last walk wey I do, na so dem bundle me, strip me naked, brutalize and dehumanize me. I no carry gun, I no carry weapon. As dem dey beat me, dem dey ask why I dey disturb Mr Governor. Now dem say make I come do walk. For another round of beating??</p><p>“Abeg o. If I wan lose weight, I go go gym. Same peaceful Walk wey Nigerian Youths do wey dem kill them? Some are still in prison.. Some have gone into hiding. Their lives no longer theirs all because we decided to walk against police brutality.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5JpZp6mlKius7%2BMn5ilsl2iv265wJyYq6eennqlscKloKedXaiur8POZqalraNivaatwp5ksJmcoHqqutWiq55n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
