This includes &#34;special event&#34; monsters that could only be obtained in certain circumstances or exploiting in-game glitches, but that was back in the day."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This includes "special event" monsters that could only be obtained in certain circumstances or exploiting in-game glitches, but that was back in the day. For the upcoming <a href=#>Pokémon Violet and Scarlet,</a> you can get a special monster just by pre-ordering the games.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is there a 'Pokémon Scarlet' and 'Violet' pre-order bonus?</h2><p>The Pokémon Company announced that players are now able to pre-order Violet and Scarlet at the Nintendo eShop, but also at game and toy retailers worldwide. If you pre-order the title, you'll be able to get your hands on a Special Pikachu. What makes it so "special," you ask? Aside from the fact that it's wearing a hat and has a few bejeweled balloons attached to its head.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: The Official Pokemon YouTube Channel</a></figure><p>Well, this little fella can use the move "fly," which is probably why it's rocking balloons. The Pikachu's Tera Type is Flying as well, meaning that it's super unique. What's more, you won't be able to capture this thing while trolling grasslands, caves, beaches, and other parts of the World Map — you'll only be able to get it through pre-order.</p><p>Those who pre-order the game will also receive a code for a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">free in-game backpack</a> to accessorize their character with.</p><p>Should you choose to purchase a digital copy of the game instead, you'll receive the Adventure Set, which includes:</p><ul><li>10 Potions</li><li>Five Full Heals</li><li>Three Revives</li><li>Three Ether</li><li>One Rare Candy</li><li>One Nugget</li></ul><p>If you purchase the double pack, you'll also receive 100 PokéBalls in each game.</p><p>At this time, it does not seem as though specific retailers are offering additional content or Pokémon-themed items for pre-ordering the game, so you can pre-order from the store of your choice.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When do 'Pokémon Scarlet' and 'Violet' come out?</h2><p>The two titles are set to debut exclusively for the Nintendo Switch on Friday, Nov. 18, 2022. The games' official website describes the titles as "the first open-world RPGs in the Pokémon series," which is a big, big deal.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>In Pokémon Scarlet & Violet, Pokémon evolve on the overworld, as opposed to a separate evolution screen. This screenshot also reveals that Scarlet & Violet will make use of a minimap. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/xnRK8vl36l</a></p>— PLDH (@PLDHnet) <a href=#>August 3, 2022</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What are the differences between 'Pokémon Violet' and 'Scarlet'?</h2><p>Deciding which game you get will determine the Pokémon that you're able to encounter randomly are you traverse the world map. The titles are set in the world of Paldea and there's an added element of Poké-weirdness incorporated into the gameplay: legendary Pokemon that turn into bikes players can ride. Seriously.</p><p>While playing Scarlet, you'll be able to traverse the world map on top of Koraidon, which looks like a red biker dragon of sorts. Miraidon is a purple long-necked lizard/snake with arms that players can also ride. If you go onto water, these monsters transform into boat-like vehicles, too.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Each of these Legendaries will function as a full-time partner in the game, something that old-heads who played Pokémon Yellow on Game Boy will appreciate as they'll recall a cute little Pikachu following them around outside of his Poké Ball. This time around, your Poke-accomplices are capable of a lot more.</p><p>While the two monsters effectively act the same, they have different animations for all three of their travel modes (gliding is included as well, so yes, it appears that there will be some form of air travel in the games).</p><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN</a> puts it: "The main difference seems to be that Koraidon uses its legs to sprint/paddle and wings to fly, while Miraidon is more mechanical in style, using its tail and throat as wheels."</p><p>The differences are lampooned in this YouTube video:</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Each version of the game will retail for $60 when they debut on the Nintendo Switch in the fourth quarter of 2022. Which one do you plan on getting?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbysscyopWark5a%2FrbHTZq2ip5yawW680Z6mq5yVp3qju82uqg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
