It is the result of a violation of its process that permits access to its mast sites. As a result, Ericsson has initiated immediate action to foil any similar attempts. All mast sites in Enugu and Port Harcourt regions have been audited while FM scanning was conducted. Critical attention was given to all high masts and sites located in mountainous areas, i.e. locations attractive for illegal activities. In addition, the Site Access Process will be reviewed for all employees and third parties.</i></p><p><i>“We sincerely regret the unfortunate incident, which violates our code of business ethics and code of conduct, contracted responsibilities as well as our company’s values</i>.”</p><p>The contract employee, David Nwawuisi is currently standing trial alongside the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO</strong>:&nbsp;Biafra: Governor Obianno Calls For Calm</p><p>According to an MTN source who pleaded anonymity, Nwawuisi was able to install the transmitters because he worked with Ericsson Nigeria Limited, as an employee of one of the companies to which the telecommunications firm outsources the maintenance of its base stations.</p><p>Another source said: “<i>The transmitters, which were used in boosting the signals of Radio Biafra allegedly transmitted from London, the United Kingdom, were discovered by the security agencies on MTN masts in Enugu and Anambra states</i>."</p><p>Another suspect, Benjamin Madubugwu, was alleged to have helped in the installation of the transmitters in Anambra state in connection with IPOB engineers.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ralph Uwazuruike, who was expelled by a faction of the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra led by Uchenna Madu, a former national director of information, said that he was not responsible for the travails of Kanu.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3l%2BlnJuZp2inrC0v86nZJynnpu2tK%2FArZysZaKWsaq7jJugmp6ilnq1vsCnqqahpKmys3nMraVmpZGowW%2B006aj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
