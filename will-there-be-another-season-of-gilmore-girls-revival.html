They got that in the form of 2016‚Äôs <a href=#><u>Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life</u></a>, but now that it‚Äôs airing on network television as well, many want to know if there will be another season.</p><p>That‚Äôs a tricky question, especially since the revival itself was a long time coming and took a while to finally gain footing and get off the ground. It happened, though, which gave many fans a renewed hope in the series that some fans had literally grown up watching. And creator Amy Sherman-Palladino seems ready and willing to give fans what they want.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But will there be a Season 2 of the 'Gilmore Girls' revival?</h2><p>Although fans were aching to see how the story might continue after the Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life "movies" ended, there still hasn't been an official word on if there will be another season, or collection of movies, to add to the story of Lorelai and Rory‚Äôs adventures. Amy Sherman-Palladino did say, however, that if everything lined up properly, she would be open to doing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another set of episodes</u></a> for the series.</p><p>"We are absolutely open to do more," she told The Hollywood Reporter in 2019. "You know, I talk to Lauren [Graham] constantly. And we‚Äôre very tight with Milo [Ventimiglia], Kelly [Bishop], and Alexis [Bledel]. We‚Äôre tight with the Gilmore family‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not anything other than we need the right story, the right format, and the right timing‚Ä¶ So it‚Äôs not about anything other than it was sort of kismet the first time. And I feel like it needs to be kismet if we do it again."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#gilmoregirls</a> I just recently discovered this Gilmore girls reboot only to discover it only has FOUR episodes and the last moment of episode 4 Rory is pregnant and I am NOT well. Plz reboot again plz plz</p>‚Äî Morgan Elise (@morganxelise) <a href=#>July 25, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The first season of the 'Gilmore Girls' revival ended with a cliffhanger.</h2><p>As it stands, the first collection of episodes (or movies, however you look at it) ended with a whopper of a cliffhanger. Rory told her devoted mom that she was pregnant and they were the three words heard around the fandom. It certainly made it seem like the plan was for more installments in the revival, especially since there were tons of questions surrounding her admission.</p><p>Mainly, the question was who Rory‚Äôs baby daddy is. In the revival, Rory is in a relationship with a guy named Paul while having Logan as her side piece. It‚Äôs pretty messy and very un-Rory-like. But by the end of the miniseries, she‚Äôs pregnant, and fans are still trying to figure out if the dad is Paul, her one night stand, Logan, Jess, or even someone else entirely.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I vote for a <a href=#>#GilmoreGirls</a> Revival P2 where Logan realises he can't live without Rory, he offers to move to Stars Hollow if that's what she wants, they raise their baby together and lives happily ever after &lt;3</p>‚Äî Charlotte üçÅ‚òïÔ∏è (@doolax3) <a href=#>February 24, 2019</a></figure><p>Sadly, though, for those who continue to ship Jess and Rory, Milo Ventimiglia, who played Jess in the series, revealed that, as they say on Maury, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jess is not the father</u></a>. At London's 2017 Heroes & Villains Fan Fest event, Milo said, "Just so you know, it's not Jess' kid,‚Äù and shattered hearts everywhere.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who would be in the other part of the 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' revival?</h2><p>Since Amy Sherman-Palladino is still close to much of the original core cast, it wouldn't be surprising if the actresses behind Rory, Lorelai, and Emily would be on board if another season is finalized. If Jess isn't the father, though, then Milo probably wouldn't need to return for a second season of the revival.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>And it's hard to say if Melissa McCarthy‚Äôs schedule with other projects would allow her to reprise her role as Sookie again. If Gilmore Girls fans had it their way, there would most definitely be another season to add to the revival, but as of right now, they will have to settle with re-watching the four movie-sized episodes over and over.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLatuIytn56qlWKvpnnAp6atoJWnerSxwKymp2Wfm3qotcumpqudXZy2s7jSZqmerpmrrq0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
