I read that somewhere, somebody said that I should apologize to the nation for backing Buhari. I never, at any time, called on people to vote for Buhari.”</p><p>He added, “On voting day, I refused to vote on that day because I could not bring myself to vote for Buhari. However, in the end, the people chose him, and when he was there, I said, give him a chance, he has met the nation at just slightly below ground zero.</p><p>“I called him and said to him that I believed that he is a born-again democrat. In the previous efforts he made, electioneering and all sorts. I believe he has learnt sufficient lessons to be called a born-again democrat.</p><p>“So, in an interview with BBC, when the lady was trying to ask me a question, I said, ‘leave him alone, he is a born-again democrat. Give him a chance.</p><p>“And she asked, ‘what happens if he disappoints? I said, ‘then, we go back to the barricades’. That section is never quoted because people do not want to go back to the barricade. They feel this is what they are supposed to do.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49tZqJlk6TCrbDNrWSbqpmjtG652KycpZ5dqbxusM5moK1lp6S5pnnSqLCippuWerS8xJqirGWfo3q3u9OipaBllqS%2Fbq7UoZiroV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
