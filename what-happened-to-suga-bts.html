Here's how he actually injured his shoulder.</h2><p>Big Hit Entertainment explained why the rapper decided to undergo surgery for his shoulder-related injury. "Suga’s shoulder issues began when he was injured in an accident that occurred in 2012 before his debut, and he was diagnosed with a dislocated shoulder in 2013," the company shared.&nbsp;</p><p>The BTS member was eventually diagnosed in 2019 with a "posterior labral tear of his left shoulder."</p><p>Though Suga received various treatments to help him perform, he continued to suffer from a wide range of symptoms including not being able to lift his arms and pain. "He underwent constant rehabilitation and treatment during his career, but unfortunately, his symptoms did not improve measurably," Big Hit wrote. "These symptoms have appeared with increasing frequency in recent years, affecting Suga not only on the stage but in the course of his daily life as well.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Fans of the rapper know that Suga has suffered with the long-time injury, and even addressed it on his song "The Last," which he penned in 2016 under the name Agust D.
