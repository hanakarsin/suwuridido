It is a possibility. They can work together only if they are willing to work for the Nigerian people. But if it is not for the benefit of the Nigerian people, you will see him not aligning with it.</p><p>“It is still three months to the election for anybody who wants to support him to do so. It is a democratic process. Nothing stops somebody from jumping camps any time anywhere. So they are free.</p><p>“There are things we don’t force. If somebody will support you, he is going to support you wholeheartedly. These are not anyhow politicians. They are governors who have their say, they are not people you force to support you. That is something that ought to be done wholeheartedly in line with their conscience.</p><p>“If you know my principal, he is somebody who likes to be open. He won’t promise you skyscrapers when he already knows what he can offer. For him, he can only offer what is good for the Nigerian people.</p><p>“Whoever wants to join him based on that principle is free. But to go and start doing political lobbying for somebody to him is a promise he can’t fulfill. It is not his style.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5FqZmtoYmh6sbHTnqlmp5KeerS8xJqirGWfo3q4u9GkoKefXay2tbSMmp6gqpmaw6awjKmbqWWXpMOmvs2oqaxn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
