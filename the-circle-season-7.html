The series is the ultimate social media competition wherein players chat with each other from their apartments and don't meet face to face until someone is blocked or until they get to the finale.</p><p>It can get intense at times, but viewers can't get enough of the hashtags, emojis, and of course, backstabbing. It's only natural to want to know when and if Season 7 of The Circle is happening. And luckily for fans, the streaming platform released details about the future of the show well before Season 6 even ended. In the words of any number of former Circle contestants, insert shocked face emoji here and send.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">When is Season 7 of 'The Circle' happening?</h2><p>According to Netflix on its <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tudum</a> news website, The Circle will return for Season 7. Unfortunately, no other information is given, but hey, beggars can't be choosers, right? OK, maybe we can be a little choosy, because come on, we need far more tea than that about the reality show and its next group of would-be Circle influencers.</p><p>Judging by past seasons of The Circle, it's possible that Season 7 will premiere in the spring of 2025 or even slightly sooner than that. Now that The Circle has a new home in the form of apartments in Atlanta, Ga., it's even possible that Season 7 was filmed right after the sixth season concluded its game.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">How long does it take to film a season of 'The Circle'?</h2><p>There have been reports that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">filming takes a few weeks</a> and that game play is at an all-time high nearly constantly. An alleged production staff member shared on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Circle subreddit</a> that filming typically lasts three weeks. However, it can't be confirmed if the user really did work on the show at some point.</p><p>Still, three or so weeks of filming makes sense for The Circle. Any longer than that for these players each sequestered in their separate apartments might be a little much. Players are kept separate from each other for the duration of the game. And, Quori-Tyler Bullock from Season 6 shared in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok about her time on the show</a>, they were blindfolded and wore headphones whenever they moved from their apartments to other locations.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>More than three weeks of that and might not make that $100,000 prize worth it.
