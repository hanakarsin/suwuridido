Instead of giving in to this pressure, she uses her social media accounts to share her book preferences, political views, and sketches.</p><p class=align-left>She enjoys travelling and often posts pictures of herself in various destinations such as Berlin, Mozambique, Kenya, and California, among others. The talented writer also enjoys visiting fashionable cafes, and the pictures she posts give her followers a peek into this side of her life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/874f4177f431ca2d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Danniella Westbrook bio: All the top details about her age, kids, drug abuse, net worth</span></p></a><h3>Elizabeth Hanks' husband</h3><p class=align-left>Is Tom Hanks daughter Elizabeth married? There has been a fair amount of speculation over the writer’s marital status. Some websites claim that she is married, but the identity of her husband remains unknown. She has not posted any pictures with her beloved yet.</p><p class=align-left>Some of her writings give insight into her thoughts on love and marriage. For her 34th birthday, the writer penned a sad <a href=# title="Tom Hank's daughter" rel="nofollow noopener">tribute to past relationships</a>. Although it is not clear whether she wrote from personal experience, she made a valid point about moving on from failed relationships and charting a new path.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/204436ac58db7a10.jpg><h3>Elizabeth Hanks' kids</h3><p class=align-left>Elizabeth does not have children yet. Multiple sources of information have revealed that Tom Hanks has <a id=https://www.mamamia.com.au/tom-hanks-children/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">only three grandchildren</a>. His son Colin has two kids, Charlotte and Olivia, and his other son Chet is the father of a little girl. The little girl's name is Michaiah. The children that Elizabeth is sometimes seen with on social media are her nieces, and this is proof that she is a<a href=# title="Elizabeth Ann Hanks" rel="nofollow noopener"> doting aunt</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d72f1a5c92c3024d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing facts about Poppy Montgomery: Family, love life and TV shows</span></p></a><h2>Elizabeth Hanks’ net worth</h2><p class=align-left>Like most aspects of her life, the writer’s net worth is not known. By looking at her trips to various destinations around the world, it is fair to assume that she is worth a decent amount. She has also worked for top magazines, which may have paid her a significant salary.</p><p class=align-left>Elizabeth Hanks comes from a famous family but still keeps the most intimate details of her life away from the public. This does not take away from the fact that she is an accomplished writer whose stories resonate with thousands of readers all over the world.</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnR8j2lrcGWVoba7rcGeq6FlmJa7rL%2BMm6CoZaedvG7AzqZkoZmeoMBusMCunqGslad7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
