After around 20 minutes of entertainment, the president arrived and the event began,” he recalled.<h2>Walking towards dais</h2><p class=align-left>As soon as the head of state arrived in the hall to give his speech, Chomba said he gathered his stamina, got hold of his identification card, and started his stroll towards the podium.</p>"The aide-de-camp noticed that I was up to something when I was about three metres to where the president stood. He quickly moved from the president’s back and signalled other officers. That is how I was arrested. I tried to shout out my grievances, but the officers whisked me away," he said.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/cd4a892bd67b000c_w.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Businessman Says He Built City with Woman Who Hustled with Him: "My Wife Is My Hero"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Chomba noted he only wanted to ask for a job from the first in command while also informing him about alleged corruption in Lamu port as he claimed he had been asked for a bribe when he asked for a job in the port.</p><h2>Arrested</h2><p class=align-left>What would follow is a tough four days as he was arrested and locked up at Mokowe Police Station.</p><p class=align-left>His phone was confiscated and was also grilled on what his real intention was.</p><p class=align-left>The 33-year-old apologised to Uhuru for the security scare and maintained he only wanted to seek help from him.</p><p class=align-left>As <a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/412759-uhuru-kenyattas-bodyguards-swiftly-swing-action-man-tries-president.html href=#><strong>TUKO.co.ke</strong> reported</a>, while giving his speech during the official opening of Lamu Port, Chomba moved close enough to the dais to startle the president.</p><p class=align-left>In the video shared, a surprised Uhuru, who had moved a step to the side when the man appeared, momentarily stopped his speech while his bodyguards swang into action and got hold of the man.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/339e6e599f157b52.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Woman Rep Loses Range Rover to Highway Robbers in Dramatic Move</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Moments later, the head of state apologised to his audience before carrying on with his speech.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
