As of late December 2023, they might not be so easy to find anymore. A ban by the United States government will effectively halt the sales of Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models for the foreseeable future. Here's what you should know about the ban and what Apple is doing to combat the decision.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">New Apple Watch models have been banned from being sold in the United States.</h2><p>Following the release of the Apple Watch Series 9 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2 in September, a medical monitoring technology company called Masimo claimed that the pulse reader technology in both watches infringes on similar pulse-oximeter technology in their own devices. The US International Trade Commission (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ITC</a>) ultimately ruled in favor of Masimo and issued a ban on Apple's latest watches from Apple stores in the United States.</p><p>Following the decision, Apple <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly</a> removed the devices in question from its website and from Apple store shelves starting on Dec. 21, 2023.</p><p>That said, the tech company is working to appeal the ban in court. In a statement published by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters</a>, an Apple spokesperson stated, "We strongly disagree with the USITC decision and resulting exclusion order and are taking all measures to return Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to customers in the US as soon as possible."</p><p>Apple previously attempted to halt the ban as they waited for an appeal, but their ITC denied the request and pushed forward with their restrictions.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>This decision affects all Apple stores in the United States and would require a presidential veto to be overturned. That said, these models will still be available through other retailers like <a href=#>Amazon</a>, Target, Best Buy, and Walmart while supplies last. As of this writing, however, it is unknown how stocks for the Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches at these stores will be affected once they run out. Additionally, the ban does not affect the Apple Watch SE.</p><p>Analysts on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Verge</a> suggest that the tech company could make software changes to their smartwatch blood oxygen tech to curtail infringement moving forward. Otherwise, they may ultimately have to reach a settlement with Masimo to avoid further litigation.</p><p>Keep reading Distractify for the latest on this news as it develops.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZK2glWK7psOMmqeppJVixKLAwqFkm5meo7Kl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
