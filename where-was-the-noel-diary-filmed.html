The plan changed along the way.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>This holiday flick was initially supposed to film in another country. More on that in a moment. First, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HITC</a>, The Noel Diary takes place in the winter wonderland-ready state of Connecticut. Justin, Barrett, who <a href=#>films Station 19 in Los Angeles</a>, and the rest of the cast actually traveled to The Constitution State to film the movie as well.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>If you are a Connecticut native or travel to the seaside state, you may recognize Westport’s Washington Avenue, which is where Jake’s family home is located. The Mechanics & Farmers Savings Bank in Bridgeport is where Jake does a book signing — although, as HITC points out, the signing happens in Chicago in the movie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Other spots that Connecticut-loving viewers may appreciate include the filming locations of Madison’s RJ Julia Booksellers, The Griswold Inn in Essex, and New Canaan’s town hall. Stamford’s Remo’s Italian restaurant hosts a memorable date between Rachel and Jake. Meanwhile, The Noel Diary takes place in a fictional town, charmingly known as Maple Falls.</p><p>Although Connecticut provided the perfect filming location for The Noel Diary, originally, the Netflix original was supposed to be shot in Vancouver, Canada. So, what happened?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Filming for ‘The Noel Diary’ was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Director Charles Shyer didn't count Connecticut as his first choice for where to film The Noel Diary. But when Canada-based production was shut down over pandemic-related concerns, he took his team to the state where the actual story takes place.</p><p>Interestingly, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CT Insider</a>, The Noel Diary was actually shot over a year ago. “We hit Connecticut in the middle of summer and there was a huge heat wave, and we’re shooting this Christmas movie with snow,” Charles told the outlet.</p><p>Despite the contradictory weather, Charles enthused, “I thought the experience was lovely. The people were great. The food was great.” He further noted that filming The Noel Diary in Connecticut was “financially good for Netflix,” and that “the neighborhoods and the feeling of family really worked for this movie.”</p><p>The Noel Diary is streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmrpqrXam1pnnNqJylZZSerrPFjJ%2BgpaWVmQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
