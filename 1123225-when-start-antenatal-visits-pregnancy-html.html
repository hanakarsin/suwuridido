These check-ups are performed by a team of health care professionals, including a general practitioner (GP, a doctor), a midwife and an obstetrician (a doctor whose specialty is pregnancy and birth).</p><p class=align-left>The importance of antenatal care should not be overlooked, as sometimes major health issues do not reveal themselves until it is too late. That is why it is important to seek antenatal care to make sure all is going well.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/36e28c20a6aac75f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Discover the usefulness of the UNN portal!</span></p></a><p class=align-left>But wait, there is more:</p><p class=align-left>Antenatal visits are also a great opportunity to ask any professional question about your pregnancy. You can discuss your concerns and tell the doctor about pains and aches. Regular visits can reduce any possible risks and help you feel at peace with your situation.</p><h2>When to start antenatal visits?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/36e28c20a6aac75f.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>10 components of reproductive health every woman should know about</p><h2></h2><p class=align-left>Many future parents ask the question:</p><p class=align-left>‘When is the right time to start antenatal visits?’ The answer is pretty simple. As soon as you think you might be pregnant, you should go to your GP and arrange antenatal care. Before you start it, though, you should decide on the time and place of your first visit, as well as what kind of care you would like to receive.</p><p class=align-left>Choose the hospital where you want to have your baby. This choice will determine the people who will be involved in your antenatal care. Depending on your wish and financial situation, you can decide between a public hospital, a private clinic or a birth centre.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytul04gpq6flk.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Should you breastfeed while pregnant?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt6fsbe116s3t.jpg><p class=align-left>During your visit to the GP, your doctor will give you all the necessary information on how to care for yourself during pregnancy.
