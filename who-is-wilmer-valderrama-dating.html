Often angels are sent to show us the way and that we can be more ... Straight out of heaven we welcome our first daughter," he wrote, along with the hashtag #ItsJustUs3Now.</p><p>The adoring hashtag is a play on the couple's (former!) hashtag, #ItsJustUsNow,&nbsp;which was debuted on Jan. 1, 2020, when the actor got down on one knee and proposed to Amanda while the couple was vacationing in sunny San Diego.&nbsp;</p><p>Wilmer posted a photo of the picturesque proposal to Instagram, along with the caption, "It's just us now."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just us now‚Äù 01-01-2020</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Wilmer Valderrama</a> (@wilmervalderrama) on Jan 1, 2020 at 9:30pm PST</p></figure><p>Back when he popped the question, an inside source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!
