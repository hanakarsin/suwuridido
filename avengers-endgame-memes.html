Will Thor, Black Widow, Captain America and Bruce Banner manage to <a href=#>kill the evil demigod Thanos</a>, who decimated the planet at the universe?</p><p>We've assembled a bunch of memes about Avengers: Endgame that are extremely relatable for any fans of the Marvel Comic Universe. Keep scrolling and send these over to your other <a href=#>Stan Lee adoring</a> friends!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. When you're just doing your homework so you can show up prepared, but the rest of the world doesn't get it.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Did I ask you how many times you read <a href=#>The Neapolitan Novels</a>, after all, Mom? Nope, I don't think so (even though they're epically long and I saw them on your nightstand more than just a couple of times around).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Because if you can't handle me at my 'Endgame' obsession phase, we're going to have to have a talk.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Even if you don't quite have the money to join the real die-hards on opening night.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>I think we can all agree that's a bit extreme. Though you could honestly make double that by just <a href=#>sitting around watching the other Avengers movies</a>, because yes, the perfect job does indeed exist.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. If you are going this weekend though, we need to establish some ground rules.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Technically, the movie is only <a href=#>57 seconds</a> over 3 hours, but the point still stands. Sorry, parents, but like, let's be real right now.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Because 'Endgame' is a bit more important than, well, most things in life, if we're being honest.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>This might be the only time in recent memory (OK, at least since the last Avengers came out) that you were not even slightly tempted to go to her place, even after she made it clear sex was on the table.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Oh, and if you are one of the lucky (and rich) people who make it out this weekend, keep the plot points to yourself.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Thank you very much.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. This is the one movie we're really, truly begging you not to spoil for the rest of us.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Anyone want to start a petition to ban people who watched it this weekend from tweeting about Endgame until the rest of us have seen it?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. Stan Lee *will* know and he *will* find you.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>You know what else Stan Lee will be doing? <a href=#>Maybe or maybe not</a> appearing in Endgame! (Just kidding, we know the answer, we just don't want to SPOIL it for you here).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. Let's agree that fan theories are allowed, though, because this one is an immediate fave.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>No really, change our minds.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10. Though, we concede, sometimes even theories can get a bit too much.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">11. But we can't resist the temptation to compare Ant-man to Eminem.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Sorry, not sorry?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">12. Or to Eric Andre, to be honest.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">13. And we're definitely not going to pass up on the chance to meme Peter Parker into one of the characters from 'Cars'.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">14. But wait, can we talk about Thor's weapons for a sec?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">15. This is the only distracted boyfriend meme we'll ever need.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Jane Foster is absolutely amazing, but she can't fly through space without a spacesuit, so....</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">16. Well, this would certainly be one hell of a twist.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Happy opening weekend and happy viewing!</p><p>Avengers: Endgame is out in theaters this Friday, April 26.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflsOmusaeqaxllaOxqK3MnmSmnZ2awA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
