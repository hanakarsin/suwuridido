Does anyone else scroll on TikTok aimlessly at night? The nighttime routine now goes as follows: brush teeth, skincare, scroll TikTok for 2 hours too long, sleep, repeat."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The nighttime routine now goes as follows: brush teeth, skincare, scroll TikTok for 2 hours too long, sleep, repeat. And we're pretty sure it's not just us.</p><p>In late August 2023, we saw a very cryptic and serious video from creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">VonViddy</a>. VonViddy, whose name is Joe Muchlinski in real life, has 168.8K followers and is known for his impressions and comedy videos. However, the video that night definitely was a tonal switch from his usual content.</p><p>So what happened to VonViddy? We break it down below.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What happened to VonViddy?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@VonViddy</a></figure><p>As mentioned earlier, VonViddy usually posts humorous and comedic videos. He posted a video on Aug. 21, 2023, that had his fans very confused and worried.</p><p>The video captioned "It's all love" opens with VonViddy introducing himself and then saying, "I want to be remembered as a creator. As a creator of videos that made people laugh, and a creator of music."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@vonviddy href=#>@vonviddy</a><p>It's all love</p><a title="♬ original sound - VonViddy - VonViddy" href=#>♬ original sound - VonViddy - VonViddy</a></figure><p>VonViddy continues by saying that he "also wants to be remembered as a camp counselor, who helped kids to make happy memories. I rather not be remembered as an addict and an alcoholic who put his family through hell, but unfortunately, that's also part of me." VonViddy then thanks his fans "who mean the world to me." VonViddy wraps up the video by stating that "All in all, I've had a terrific life. I have nothing to complain about and I have nothing but peace and love for each and every one of you.</p><p>Naturally, fans were worried about the content. One commented, "Your message seems like a goodbye, idk what's going on man I hope it's not, but your content is great and you're a positive person. love u brother." Sadly, this fan was right, this was a goodbye video as VonViddy passed away on Aug. 21, 2023.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What was VonViddy's cause of death?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@martha_merced href=#>@martha_merced</a><p>Joe was my first word. He was my older brother, my only sibling, and this is one of the worst days of my life. I know folks have been concerned since his (Vonviddy's) last video and deserve some closure.@VonViddy <a title=vonviddy href=#>#vonviddy</a> <a title=closure href=#>#closure</a> <a title=mentalhealthmatters href=#>#mentalhealthmatters</a> <a title=mentalillness href=#>#mentalillness</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - martha merced" href=#>♬ original sound - martha merced</a></figure><p>Joe's sister, Martha Muchlinski, took to TikTok to break the news. In a video posted the same day as VonViddy's death, Martha confirmed that "He did lose his long battle with mental illness, and he did take his own life." She continued by saying, "TikTok meant a lot to him, it gave him joy, it gave him something to laugh at and to make other people laugh at and he really appreciated that." Martha ended the video and said that she's "hoping that he's at peace."</p><p>Martha captioned the video, "Joe was my first word. He was my older brother, my only sibling, and this is one of the worst days of my life. I know folks have been concerned since his (VonViddy's) last video and deserve some closure."</p><p>VonViddy's death has come after a string of other <a href=#>TikToker</a> deaths including Dazharia Shaffer, Siya Kakkar, and Cooper Noriega.</p><p>RIP VonViddy. We hope your soul is finally at peace.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSvp56rtqWw2A%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
