When compared to marriages in Igbo and Yoruba land, it is less expensive and dramatic. The processes of Hausa marriage could be broken into the following six processes:</p><h3>1. Na gani ina</h3><p class=align-left>Like most marriages in Nigeria, the first step is seeking the consent of the parents of the bride after the groom or his family has made their choice. This is often referred to as ‘Na gani ina’ which means what I see.

Friendship between the couple</h3><p class=align-left>Upon being satisfied with the findings made, the groom is then allowed to see the bride briefly. This is to help them know each other a little.</p><p class=align-left>The family discourages them from having any form of physical contact or courting. If the bride-to-be is in agreement with the whole marriage proposal, then the parents of the man make the move to formally ask for the girl’s hand in marriage.</p><p class=align-left>Although, this method may be slightly different for all the tribes in that part of the country, it is presumed to be the most common.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong>: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Do you have news to share?
