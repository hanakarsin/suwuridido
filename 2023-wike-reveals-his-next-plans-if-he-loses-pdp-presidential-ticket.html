I will support PDP, I will make sure PDP wins the election. I am not those when anything happens they run away from the party. I will not leave this party because everything I am today, it is PDP that has given it to me. So I owe PDP a lot,” he was quoted to have said.</p><p>He added that he already enjoys massive support across all the regions in Nigeria and all that remains is the party ticket for him to go and win the 2023 presidential election for the PDP.</p><p>“Everywhere, Wike has taken over. Go to the north it’s Wike; go to the east, it’s Wike, go to the west, it’s Wike, go to the south, it’s Wike. Ogun state is Wike. Everybody, it’s Wike.”</p><p>The Rivers State Governor boasted that if elected as the next President of Nigeria, he would end banditry within his first six months in office.</p><p>He said whatever the security agencies require to make it happen will be provided for them as there can’t be development without peace.</p><p>He said; “Once there is insecurity you can’t do anything. You must have peace for investors to come in, for people to set up industries. So the basic thing in my first six months as president of Nigeria is to end banditry. All those bandits, let them wait for me. I will pursue them. It is my job. I will provide to security agencies whatever they require.”</p><p>He blamed the administration of <strong>President Muhammadu Buhari</strong> and the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the challenges facing Nigeria on many fronts but promised to right the wrongs if he gets elected.</p><p>“Today, we are suffering. We are in opposition. Who are those who plotted against us? Who are those who masterminded for us to lose the 2015 election? Today, we are crying that we are in opposition, today we are fighting how to take back power. Who are those people who took the power that PDP had and gave it to APC. You know them.”</p><p>“Nigeria has never been divided a country as is divided today. Our founding fathers never made mistake that there should be a country called Nigeria. God never made mistake that there should be a country called Nigeria,” Wike said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5BuZmtoYmh6uLXKnmSrnaaarq2%2FjKGgrGWemsW1ec%2BlmKerXZ6zbrTEZqOoq5WoerGwz2anq52jnrGmutOimKVlpJ6wrLHTaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
