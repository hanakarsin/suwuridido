The defendant also faces a gun allegation and that he personally inflicted great bodily injury."<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What's Tory Lanez's jail time now?</h2><p>Lanez could now face up to 22 years and 8 months in jail, since the LA County DA's office charged him with one count of assault with a gun, and another one of carrying a loaded, unregistered gun in his car. Moreover, the DA says Lanez "inflicted great bodily injury." To be clear, this doesn't mean he's been convicted, so the 22 years is not what his actual prison time is&nbsp;— it's what it could be if the judge and jury find that Lanez is guilty of shooting Megan.&nbsp;</p><p>TMZ believes <a href=# rel=nofollow>Lanez is going to claim </a>that it was an accidental shooting, and it may actually be difficult to prove that it wasn't, since Megan had initially posted on social media (the post has since been deleted) that she had her back to the SUV when he shot her heel. However, we'll find out more information soon, as his arraignment is scheduled for October 13.&nbsp;</p><p>Neither Lanez nor Megan have officially responded to the recent news. Our thoughts are with Megan, who suffered senseless violence, and deserves justice.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbyzxYylmKedqmK3orXLZquipZU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
