The hit Bravo show is set to return in February of 2020, and it'll be a season unlike any other."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Past seasons of Summer House showcased the various cast members partying at bars and at houses dotted along the coastline. For Season 5, which was filmed in July of 2020, the reality stars all stayed at their digs.</p><p>But just because the cast is isolating together at their rental doesn't mean the drama will end. Past Summer House roommates Carl Radke, <a href=#>Lindsay Hubbard</a>, Luke Gulbranson, Hannah Berner, Paige DeSorbo, Kyle Cooke, Amanda Batula, and Danielle Olivera are back for the new season.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ciara Miller</a> is the only cast addition for Season 5, and she's set to ruin the friendly relationship shared between exes Hannah and Luke. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Ciara Miller from 'Summer House'?</h2><p>The newest Bravolebrity is connected to the group through Season 4 addition Luke Gulbranson. She's originally from Atlanta, but she moved to Houston back in March of 2020. When she's not sipping cocktails while poolside in the Hamptons, she's a nurse in the ICU.&nbsp;She received her Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing at Chamberlain University.</p><p>Ciara finished school in May of 2018, and she referred to her graduation day as "the greatest day EVERRR." She wrote about how hard she worked in nursing school on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>"Let me just say that I am so glad that nursing school is over and I am forever thankful for all the experiences... Let me just say that I didn't even fill out my nursing school application. My mom did," she wrote. "I knew I wanted to be in the medical field and I knew nursing would be a good fit for me, but I wasn't sure that I was cut out for it."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"Even when I got accepted and throughout the entire program I still didn't think I had what it took to be a nurse, and I was literally waiting to fail at some point in time. With a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, I didn't," Ciara continued. "I could finally exhale and tell myself that I was good enough, only when I passed the NCLEX [National Council Licensure Examination]."</p><p>"I love fighting to prove myself wrong but I also I love proving all the other people over the years wrong when they told me I would never be a nurse, or when people questioned my intelligence because of looks..." she concluded, before referring to herself as a "model & nurse."</p><p>Before her time on the show, Ciara was a frontline worker for COVID-19 efforts. It's unclear if she returned to her post after filming Summer House.</p><p>She's also been modeling, and she's represented by both Salt and Link Models.&nbsp;</p><p>It appears as if Ciara is single, and she will be causing a stir among some of the other single Summer House cast members.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">It looks like Ciara will come between friendly exes Luke and Hannah.</h2><p>Based on the Season 5 trailer, which was obtained by<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> People</a>, Ciara definitely turned some heads upon her entrance into the house.&nbsp;She piqued Danielle Olivera's interest.</p><p>"Ciara made her presence known," Danielle says in the teaser. "I would f--k her."</p><p>While Ciara is initially portrayed as Luke's friend, it seems like the two have a romance going on. In her confessional, Paige shares that Ciara is out of Luke's league.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Luke's ex, Hannah, isn't happy that he's flaunting his feelings for Ciara in front of her.</p><p>"We dated for seven months and you f-----g rub her in my face to make me feel bad?" Hannah exclaims in the trailer.&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't know what world you're living in, but it's not reality," Luke responds.&nbsp;</p><p>With all of the drama surrounding Luke and his various dalliances with the other cast members, it isn't likely that he'll be involved with Ciara for long.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ciara (@seeyaciaa)</a></p></figure><p>The trailer shows that Luke may have a tryst with Lindsay while she's on a break from her beau.
