She met her BF, Simon Marco, at the Cannes Film Festival.</h2><p>Bria and her crew are killing it in their respective career fields, which fans will see when Summer House: Martha’s Vineyard premieres on Sunday, May 7, 2023. Born and raised in New York City, Bria is a model, makeup artist, and entrepreneur with multiple beauty and fashion companies — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bria Beauty Cosmetics</a>, House of Louisa Munich, and Bria Beauty Skin.</p><p>Although Bria is undoubtedly a boss in her own right, she prioritizes her relationships with her friends and her boyfriend, entrepreneur <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Simon Marco</a>. Bria and Simon began dating in 2022 and were only together for a few months before Bria moved into the Martha’s Vineyard house. Still, in the pilot episode, she made it abundantly clear that she was “wifed up” and dedicated to her and Simon’s union.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Bria told us that she and Simon met at the Cannes Film Festival in France. She attended the festival through her film program while Simon was busy styling the models and actors on the red carpet. They connected through a meet-cute at a restaurant when Bria’s high school friend ditched her, and Simon noticed Bria was alone and offered to buy her a few drinks.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“I ended up just staying, and I had some drinks with him,” Bria exclusively told Distractify of Simon. “And then we hit it off, and we started dating right away.</p><p>Though she was “skeptical” about him initially, Bria and Simon’s outing turned into them spending days traveling to Italy and learning more about each other there.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bria moved to Germany to be closer to Simon several months into their relationship.</h2><p>After dating for several months, Bria <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">moved to Munich, Germany</a>, to live with Simon, whom she describes as a supportive and encouraging partner. However, she still had some understandable concerns about being in an interracial relationship overseas.</p><p>“'Im like, ‘Well, is there Black people there? Like, what's going on?” Bria said about moving with Simon. “I needed to know where I was staying. Am I going to be OK?”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After some reassurance from Simon that she would be “fine,” Bria got on a bus to Germany from Milan and has been there “ever since”! Despite being away from each other for extended periods due to Bria's involvement in the show, Simon has supported her decision to join the cast of Summer House.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“When I started filming the show, I told him, I'm like, ‘Hey, I'm gonna be on this show.’ And he was so open to it and 100 percent supporting me and hyping me up even before this show,” Bria said of her man. “And I'm like, ‘Listen, I'm a person that, once I get there, I'll get hyped up. But, like, I'm not like you.’ But he [thinks] this is a great opportunity because here [Germany], and Europe, it’s different living in a different mentality. So for him, it's very big.”</p><p>Bria's love and respect for Simon shine through in her words as she assures us that their bond is strong enough to withstand any challenges that may arise during filming.</p><p>“He [Simon] knows I would never play myself in any way or disrespect our relationship,” Bria declared. “And I cherish it. He's, very confident, and I'm the same with him. And that's how we're very transparent. We communicate a lot about our feelings and are very open.”</p><p>We wish Bria and Simon the best in their relationship and can't wait to see how their love story plays out on the show!</p><p>Summer House: Martha’s Vineyard airs Sundays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2BqrYyfo56lmaO0br%2FUpqSeql2dvLa%2FxGabmqyZo7Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
