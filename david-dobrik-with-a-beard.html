At least, that's what fans thought up until now.

As the podcaster, content creator, and Youtube mastermind revealed back then, he regards the activity as an absolute must.&nbsp;</p><p>If we take a swift look at David's Youtube uploads, what we'll discover is a vast number of videos narrated by a perfectly-shaved, smooth-faced young man.&nbsp;Coincidence? Probably not.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Hair removal is a frequent topic on David's vlogs.&nbsp;</h2><p>Many of David's four-minute and 20-second-long videos revolve around hair removal, and a few of them feature hair-dying and hair-cutting related pranks.&nbsp;</p><p>See, for instance, the episode where the Squad decides to help <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonah</a> transform into an entirely new person. To make this happen, they rid him of every single piece of hair, including eyebrows, beard, chest hair, and the fluffy thatch proliferating on his back in just one sitting.&nbsp;</p><p>And, let's not forget about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scotty Sire</a>'s frequent hairstyle changes – remember his icy blonde locks? This topic also makes up a frequent topic of discussion on the vlog.&nbsp;</p><p>Or, take Liza Koshy, an ex-Vlog Squad member whose go-to look involved a mustache and a thick stubble drawn on her face with a sharpie.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, David never appeared on the vlog with a fully grown beard. Which is why a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recent Instagram story</a> left his biggest fans completely shook.&nbsp;</p><p>Which brings us to wonder: Is David taking Zane's lead? Will he try and grow a beautifully thick, well-groomed beard like his? Could there be dyeing involved as well?&nbsp;Will there be beard-themed pranks, or would the topic of facial hair be treated as slightly more serious than the usual stream of pranks that make up the bulk of the vlog?&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While the above questions might be entirely hypothetical, one thing is certain. David made an appearance with enough facial hair to classify as a beard. Which is a sensation in and of itself, without a doubt.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">David Dobrik's beard inspired fans and content creators alike.&nbsp;</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beautify Atlanta</a> ventured as far as to dedicate an entire article helping readers achieve the perfect stubble David was recently spotted with.&nbsp;</p><p>As the outlet vouches, those aspiring to create a similar look should begin by consulting a professional barber – always a good idea – and prepare themselves for the time spent waiting for the beard to grow.&nbsp;</p><p>We only have one question left: Will there be more beard-themed content on David's vlog?&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma63tcNmm6iaop64bsPIrZ9mmV2XsqK%2Bww%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
