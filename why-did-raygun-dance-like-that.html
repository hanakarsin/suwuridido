I go out there, and I show my artistry. Sometimes it speaks to the judges, and sometimes it doesn't. I do my thing, and it represents art. That is what it is about.”</p><p>Outside of her Olympic performance, Raygun is an academic who has studied music and dance, specializing in Breakdancing. Her PhD thesis was titled Deterritorializing Gender in Sydney's Breakdancing Scene: A B-girl's Experience of B-boying, studying the " intersection of gender and Sydney’s breaking culture." Though her performance netted her <a href=#>no points</a> at the Olympics, breakdancing has long been her section of expertise professionally.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Rachael Gunn (@raygun_aus)</a></p></figure><p>She issued a response to the hate she's received in a video on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, where she claims she took her time at the Olympics "very seriously."</p><p>"I worked my butt off preparing for the Olympics and I gave my all, truly," she continued.
