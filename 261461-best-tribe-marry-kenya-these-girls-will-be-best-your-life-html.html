The former is due to marital stereotypes and personal experiences associated with specific ethnic groups and genders.</p><h2>Tribes that make good intermarriages</h2><p class=align-left>Many Kenyans admit to intermarriage as the most proper way of integrating the 42 ethnic groups. Many famous people have already embraced intermarriage, with the best example being Orengo's daughter, who tied the knot with a Kamba man. Even then, most Kenyans still think that some ethnic groups are more compatible compared to others.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/11f5a852cfb9b60a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Pastor K N Jacob Says Wife Has Right to Hubby's Phone: "She Must Know Every Deal You Transact"</span></p></a><h2>Which are the best tribes to marry in Kenya?</h2><p class=align-left>The best tribe for marriage in Kenya is heavily dependent on one's tribe and background. For example, urban kids are less familiar with tribal rituals, making them more adaptive to other ethnic communities. But, for the record, anyone from any tribe can marry if they find their dream mate and achieve mutual understanding throughout the relationship's development.</p><p class=align-left>Different ethnic groups are now alienated by specific practices and characters which attract or repel prospective partners. For instance, dating a Kalenjin man is a lifetime commitment regardless of the hurdles.</p><h3>1. The Kalenjin</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/11f5a852cfb9b60a.jpeg><p class=align-left>Once you get married into the Kalenjin community, there is no going back. The tribe is very strict when it comes to divorce.<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Kalenjin men</a> are very dominant, and they will make all the decisions in the house. They nonetheless are dubbed to be good in bed. Their women are taught to be submissive to their husbands and to take care of their children.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ec8f375c0e318350.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Saving Tips: Musician Akothee Shares 5 Steps on Owning a House</span></p></a><h2>2. Kamba</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/ab424a782c88e495.jpeg><p class=align-left>Kamba men show desirable levels of loyalty and satisfaction in their routine lives. Dating a Kamba man is, hard for most women simply because they are not aggressive and are overruling. It is equally important to state that Kamba men score well in bed.</p><p class=align-left>On the other hand, the thought of Kamba ladies for marriage has long been embattled. Among other personal reasons, many Kenyan men do not perceive them suitable for long-term <a href=#>relationships</a> because they are dynamic minded.</p><p class=align-left>It is, however, important to realize that Kamba women are submissive and loving in nature if you treat them right. Therefore, all stereotypes infringed against them are not necessarily true on the rate of “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mpango wa kando</a>” tendency revealed along tribal lines.</p><h3>3. Kikuyu</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ec8f375c0e318350.jpeg><p class=align-left>Kikuyu women are among the most discussed group that attracts a lot of controversies. However, marrying a Kikuyu woman is suitable, considering their high academic exposure and hardworking traits. Besides their universal beauty, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kikuyu women</a> are loving and intelligent. It is also true that they are outgoing, which makes them a compatible fit for our brothers from Luo Nyanza.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/da6224ba3ee480b3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Unmarried Tharaka Nithi Woman Decries Shortage of Husbands in Mt Kenya: "Alcoholism is Big Issue"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Their men are also very hardworking and a bit<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> stingy with </a>their money. They must ensure that every cent is accounted, and they are suitable if you are looking for an industrious man.</p><h2>4. Luhya</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/ee8f70b22b2ed2f0.jpeg><p class=align-left>The Abaluhya people, who originate from the Western parts of Kenya, have the most voluptuous women in the country and are hardworking.

Many ladies have fallen for their charms and the sweet words that come out of their mouths. However, Luo men are also known for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">infidelity</a> and arrogance. Nevertheless, they have produced several notable Kenyan <a href=#>musicians </a>such as <a href=#>Khaligraph Jones</a> and Otile Brown.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/672798ebc7bc131a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Toxic Bosses, Work Places: Kenyans Share Experiences that Made Them Quit Their Jobs</span></p></a><p class=align-left>On the other hand, their women are known for their figures and ability to cook fish, which is no surprise since they originate from Lake Victoria.</p><h3>6.

Taita</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/ecb70b1a27ef5897.jpeg><p class=align-left>Women from the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Taita community</a> have gathered praises as some of the most beautiful in the country.
