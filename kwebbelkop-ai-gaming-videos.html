Source: Kwebbelkop/TwitterAfter years of working to amass a YouTube following of more than 15 million viewers, Kwebbelkop (real name Jordi Van Den) is ready to retire. However, it looks like he’s not ready to let his YouTube channel sit and gather dust, so instead he’s developed an AI replica of himself to take the reins."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But just because the creator now has the tools to generate entirely AI videos, it sounds like those won't be the only videos uploaded to his channel.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>“Gonna say this one final time,” reads a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a> from Kwebbelkop. “Kwebbelkop AI is not 100% AI, so all the comments about how it’s soulless and how it’s AI make you look really stupid.”</p><p>Kwebbelkop also notes that he has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">removed himself from the YouTube channel</a> and is “now 100% focused on only making content via AI.”</p><p>For now, it seems like there will still be some input from the Kwebbelkop team when producing these new AI-generated videos — though it’s unclear what form that will take. It also seems like the goal is for 100% AI videos to eventually take over the entire channel, and fans are mixed on how they feel about the AI takeover.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>“I don’t care if it's 80% AI or 20%, it doesn’t feel human,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> one viewer.</p><p>Another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">viewer</a> claims that “if [Kwebbelkop] just did this in silence and stopped talking so much smack, [they’d] have so much more impact.”</p><p>One of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">harshest comments</a> says that Kwebbelkop “hit rock bottom and then somehow kept digging.”</p><p>While a large portion of the community isn’t a fan of the switch to AI, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">others</a> are saying that this just might be the future of entertainment.</p><p>“Think we start to see more and more YouTubers head this way, AI is the future whether you like it or not.”</p><p>Many others say that they don’t care about AI — as long as the content is entertaining and they can’t tell the difference, then it doesn’t matter how it was generated.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Bro hit rock bottom and then somehow kept digging 💀</p>— cernersandals (@cernersandals) <a href=#>August 17, 2023</a></figure><p>Since making the jump to AI content, Kwebbelkop has seen a boost in viewership.
