There are some infamous TV moments that will always go down in history. Like that time a contestant on The Newlywed Game accidentally talked about anal sex, or this amazing moment from Survivor.

The idea behind it is that they've gone their whole lives with this 'deformity' or somewhat shocking deviation from the norm.</p><p>This is probably more common in athletes who push their bodies to extremes, often times for years, and have balances or accumulated trauma in a specific region that simply doesn't look all that right by the time they're done. They can go their whole careers with no one batting an eye so long as the area isn't affected by injury, but once retirement comes, usually the fun facts about what years in a sport has done to them does as well. We're not talking some petty details like how some actresses have their hands pointed out for looking weird while they clap. Read on and you'll see what I'm talking about.</p><p>Then there are some gross things that you just can't unsee, and I blame Fear Factor for a lot of those moments. For instance, I'm still traumatized by watching people eat extra large dung beetles or boiled antelope brains.</p><p>And the latest in unseeable, unforgettable on-air grossness doesn't come from a nasty food challenge or a misunderstanding about newlywed sex.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">It comes courtesy of Shaq's feet.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#shaq</a>'s feet 😷 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2OMFoO1GSg</a></p>— BallerAlert (@balleralert) <a href=#>May 26, 2017</a></figure><p>The NBA Hall of Famer put his size 22 foot on full display during the Cavs game this past Thursday night and well, people were horrified.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Like, really horrified.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>NOOOOOO SHAQQQ NO NO NO THAT'S NOT RIGHT NEVER WILL I EAT AGAIN. <a href=#>#ShaqToe</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/iIuMVdR6Df</a></p>— JustAGirlfrNEOHIO💋 (@lilmommamma) <a href=#>May 26, 2017</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I can't unsee Shaq's feet <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FMN3hAZpXg</a></p>— Zero Dark 33 🏀 (@BuckeyesGirl33) <a href=#>May 26, 2017</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">They just couldn't comprehend his big toe.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@NBAonTNT</a> <a href=#>@SHAQ</a> get your radioactive big toe off my TV, I'm trying to eat 😂</p>— Pete Kostopanagiotis (@PeteKosto) <a href=#>May 26, 2017</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>SHAQ'S TOE LOOKS LIKE IT'S TRYING TO RUN AWAY.
