While feeling parched and in need of <a href=#>a drink of water</a>, it took her nearly 20 minutes to find the water spout. Here’s what went down.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">A woman shares her struggle to find a water spout in her confusing smart fridge.</h2><p>It could all be so simple. In an Aug. 5, 2023 TikTok video, creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tara Marie (@tmkd15)</a> shared how she struggled to find the water spout in her confusing smart fridge.</p><p>“These 'smart' fridges have really [gotten] too complex for me. It took me a solid 15-20 minutes of effort and research to get water from my best friend’s @Samsung bespoke fridge,” the video caption reads.</p><p>As the video starts, a silver fridge is in the frame with a text overlay that reads, “Me at 7 a.m. dying of thirst and unable to find any water in this 'smart fridge.'"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@tmkd15 href=#>@tmkd15</a><p>These “smart” fridges have really gotten too complex for me.

She shared that it’s early in the morning and she’s dying for a drink of water.</p><p>“Where ... could this water thing be hiding,” Tara said. "There’s a water filter. So there’s water, right?”</p><p>Tara shared that she’s opened all the compartments to no avail.</p><p>“There’s a water spout somewhere in this stupid smart fridge,” Tara said.</p><p>After opening the freezer compartments and re-opening the fridge, Tara then looks to Google for answers. She even texts a friend and looks at social media.</p><p>“So I thought to myself, surely TikTok will have the answer,” the text overlay reads on a TikTok search.</p><p>Tara shared that after looking through 10 TikTok videos, she finally found someone with the fridge who helped her.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@tmkd15</a></figure><p>“I see her open it and I’m like, ‘OK, I’m not crazy. There is water in this fridge.' All I have to do is open the doors,” Tara said.</p><p>Interestingly, it took Tara some time to play with the doors and compartments in the exterior of the fridge before she finally found the right section.</p><p>“I’m feeling and I find it,” Tara said. “Yeah! Here we go. I have never been so happy to find water in my entire life.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">TikTok users with a similar fridge understand Tara’s plight.</h2><p>We all love major appliance upgrades, but Tara’s video shows that it can be hard to find the simplest things when you need them the most. And since the Samsung fridge is popular on TikTok, many people who own the appliance shared their initial struggle.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@tmkd15</a></figure><p>“My dad has this fridge and I was so confused the first time I tried to get water out of it,” one user said.</p><p>“OMG. My friends have this fridge and I just used the sink for months because I was too embarrassed to ask,” another person shared.</p><p>Now that the case of finding the water spout has been solved, quenching your thirst should not be an issue moving forward.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLyvstSsoKefXai6or7TZp2roZScsm7DwK2cq2Wjpby2wA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
