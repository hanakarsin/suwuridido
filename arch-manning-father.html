Source: YouTubeThere are very few families with more of a legacy in the NFL than the Manning family. Peyton and Eli Manning are both Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks and their father, Archie, was also a starting quarterback for the Saints
Now, following the retirement of both brothers, attention has shifted to Arch Manning, a younger member of the family who may be poised to take on their legacy in the NFL."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Washington. He went 21-of-27 with 241 yards and had two touchdowns. He also rushed for two additional touchdowns and threw two interceptions. Although he didn't play a perfect game, he certainly turned heads.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does Arch's dad Cooper Manning do?</h2><p>Even as he nurtures his son's football career, Cooper has also made a career of his own by commentating on the world of professional football. Currently, he's the host of The Manning Hour on Fox Sports, and he's also a director of investor relations at AJ Capital Partners. He may not have a career in football, but Peyton and Eli's older brother has managed to make a fine life for himself anyway.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Cooper Manning with brothers Eli and Peyton in 2013.</p></figure><p>Cooper's career has given him the resources he needs to keep Arch at the Isidore Newman School, which is a private school that Eli and Peyton also attended, as did <a href=#>Odell Beckham Jr.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>The school has a reputation for its ability to churn out great talent, and it's looking like Cooper's son may be on that list, having started for the team when he was only a freshman.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Peyton Manning have a son?</h2><p>If Arch does make it to the NFL, he's going to have to live up to the careers of all the Mannings who played the game before him. That includes his uncle Peyton, who just recently retired from the game after a hugely successful career.&nbsp;</p><p>Arch is the only young Manning playing football right now, but both Peyton and Eli also have children who may make their way toward the game as they get older.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Peyton with his son Marshall in 2016.</p></figure><p>Peyton has twins (a boy and a girl) with his wife Ashley. Marshall and Mosley are 9 years old, so neither one of them is into tackle football just yet, while Eli is the proud dad to three girls (Lucy, Ava, and Caroline) and a boy named Charles.&nbsp;</p><p>In a family with football genes that appear to be as strong as the Mannings, though, it may just be a matter of time before Peyton or Eli's sons decide they are interested in following in their dads' footsteps.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2BktIymmKemmaO0brLArZ%2Beqg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
