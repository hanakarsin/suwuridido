However, it was only recently that we learned that he has been fighting a silent battle with diabetes for the last several months.</p><p>“He's diabetic, he was just recently diagnosed with diabetes within the past year,” Sakoya revealed. “And it's new for him.”</p><p>"A lot of us aren't as educated as others are when it comes to being diabetic and the steps you have to take to take care of yourself … to stick [yourself] with the needle and all these other things that come with it,” the Growing Up Hip Hop star went on. “He's still trying to figure those things out and just take good care of himself.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Pray for Jojo from Jodeci he’s going through it!

In fact, they’ve been separated for more than a decade now.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>“I just wanted to clarify because people are like, ‘Jojo had a stroke and Tiny left,’” she said. “No, Jo has never had a stroke. That's not what that was.</p><p>“I would never leave somebody because they're sick or turn my back," she continued. "Even in my relationship with Layzie … if Jojo is sick, I will go and see about him if need be.”</p><p>“It's never about money, or status, or any of that," she added. "I'm generally a caring human being. That's just what it is.”</p><p>You can catch Sakoya and Tiny on new episodes of Growing Up Hip-Hop Thursdays at 9 p.m. EST on WE tv.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7yru4yhmKKkla56qbHApauh</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
