However, their family dynamic looks a little different now.</p><p>Not long after Christine and Janelle made the bombshell announcement that they were leaving the plural family, Meri followed suit.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kody and Meri Brown have officially called it quits.</h2><p>Over the years, Kody has weathered marital issues with not one but all three of his spouses. But before the polygamous family came to be, Kody only had one wife: Meri. Their <a href=#>breakup</a> came as a shock to viewers given her long history of loyalty to her former husband.</p><p>Following the family breakdown, Meri switched her focus to her business — her online clothing store. She’s a distributor for the controversial <a href=#>multi-level marketing</a> company, <a href=#>LuLaRoe</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">‘Sister Wives’ star Meri Brown’s clothing business has faced criticism in the past.</h2><p>Although LuLaRoe has been proven to be a <a href=#>pyramid scheme</a> in the past, Meri hasn’t given up on the business just yet. In her Instagram bio, there’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a link</a> to her clothing website, which offers an array of women’s clothing — including shirts, dresses, shorts, and more! Products on the site range from $25 to $64.</p><p>But longtime fans of the show know that this isn’t Meri’s first rodeo. The Sister Wives star has shown herself to be business-minded before, as she previously invested in a <a href=#>bed and breakfast</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, whatever happened to Meri’s B&B? Here’s an update on Lizzie’s Heritage!</h2><p>Despite the devastation that COVID-19 had on the hospitality industry, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lizzie’s Heritage Inn</a> has still managed to stay afloat. Meri opened the B&B, located in Parowan, Utah, in 2017. Her mom worked as an innkeeper at the property — which previously belonged to Meri’s great-grandparents — until she died in 2021.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When she first pitched the idea for the B&B to Kodi and his other wives, they shot it down. In the end, the entrepreneur secured the $40,000 loan she needed to buy the place on her own.</p><p>Thanks to her previous endeavors, it looks like our good sis(ter wife) is bringing in the big bucks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/zjImOSIFN/200x200/taylor-honore-1653380227962.jpg><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But what’s Meri Brown’s net worth? Details!</h2><p>Meri is worth an estimated $400,000 per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. This is pretty impressive given the Sister Wives cast’s modest salaries. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">InTouch</a> reported that each of the stars is making as little as $50,000 per season, which can go fast when you’re supporting a family of 20+.</p><p>It’s a good thing Meri knows how to generate multiple streams of income!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforKztYysoKyslad6uLXVnqpmm5ykwam1zaBkm62jnrumv9I%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
