Not only did he co-create Woke, which is adapted from his life, but Keith is also a producer and writer on the series. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a>, Keith actually drew the comics featured on the show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@iamkeithknight</a><p>Keith Knight</p></figure><p>While Keef's popular comic strip in Woke is called Toast & Butter, Keith Knight's real-life comic strip is called The K Chronicles. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keith's official website</a>, The K Chronicles are "a weekly, semi-autobiographical comic strip based on the life of cartoonist/rapper/ne’er-do-well Keith Knight. Fresh, sharp, topical, and edgy, the strip offers a strange and hilariously twisted view of the world through the eyes and pen of your average, African-American male."</p><p>Speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Comics Beat</a>, the artist explained Keef's central conflict in Season 1 of Woke. "I think a lot of times people go to comic cons to get away from the real world. And that idea of fantasy, I get that," he said.</p><p>"That’s part of the dilemma of what the character [Keef Knight] talked about in the first season of Woke. Why does it have to be about something? We need that escapism, we need joy, we need to not just be about depressing stuff and politics and race and all the issues."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>Unfortunately, Keith knows all too well that sometimes it is about those issues. According to an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Indy Week,</a> Keef's encounter with police in the series was inspired by a similar incident Keith experienced 20 years ago<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>. He noted that "racism is evergreen in this country; police brutality is evergreen. It would be relevant at any time."</p><p>The cartoonist explained to Comic Beat that while there's great value in escapism through things like comics, we still "have to be inclusive and listen to voices of marginalized groups."</p><p>"I think it’s important that people bring their stories [into these worlds]. I’ve always been an advocate of telling your own story, because if other people tell your story for you, they’ll get it completely wrong. It’s super important for us to do that."</p><p>Seasons 1 and 2 of Woke are currently streaming on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuw86knGagpaHCbq7ArJydZZ%2BjeqJ506usnmWjqbyzxQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
