In a second part of the clip that's zoomed in towards the entrance into the gated section of the area she recorded her video in, a figure can be seen walking past an orange light, briefly blocking it out.</p><p>"I didnt even see him which is absolutely crazy," the woman writes in an overlay for the video, while adding #stalker in the video's caption and judging from the comments uploaded by other viewers, they had a hard time catching the figure as well.</p><p>"Bro it took me about 9 times to see it," one person wrote.</p><p>Another penned, "it’s a scary world out ther be safe ml x"</p><p>"it’s a scary world out ther be safe ml x," another viewer remarked.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @theclouddogg</span></figure><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">End Violence Against Women initiative group</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">80% of women in this survey said that they felt unsafe</a> while walking or running alone at night.</p><p>Runner's World also posted a piece stating that 60% of women who frequently run outside as a form of exercise have purportedly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">been harassed or made to feel unsafe</a>.</p><p>The Guardian published a piece that highlighted responses from female runners in the aftermath of the monstrous kidnapping and murder of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">34-year-old mom of two Eliza Fletcher</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @theclouddogg</span></figure><p>One person the outlet interviewed was a woman named Jamie who said that they intentionally head outdoors with a concealed firearm as a means of protecting herself. She highlighted a scary encounter where the mere presence of the gun quickly dissuaded a potential attack.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @theclouddogg</span></figure><p>"Women who carry while running are not monolithic, but we are often characterized as such in the media. We are characterized as right-wing, aggressive, backward-thinking, and ignorant of the risks of gun ownership. I am none of these. I am educated, politically moderate, and sane," she told the publication.</p><p>Jamie added: "I was followed around a popular lake trail by a man who exposed himself to me … about a half mile later, I heard steps behind me and it was him. I put my hand on my [up until then concealed] pistol like I was about to draw and I told him to get away from me."</p><p>The woman said that was all she needed to do to send her would-be assailant scattering out of there.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @theclouddogg</span></figure><p>However, the outlet highlighted how some argued against running with a firearm, stating that real-life scenarios where one's adrenaline is flowing, or having the money to access your gun in the first place after being attacked is an entirely different story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mpqdlnp60qcCMsJilo12Wubit2KxkraqlqMFuxc6uqWacn5w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
