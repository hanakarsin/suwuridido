Some economic problems in Nigeria are gradually reducing, while others are worsening. The country is steadily working on its economic challenges as it aspires to be among the top economies in the <a href=#>world</a> someday.</p><h2>What are the economic problems in Nigeria?</h2><p class=align-left>An economic problem means the government tries to satisfy the country's unlimited wants and needs, but resources are limited. People have endless desires, but the resources to meet those needs are scarce. Below are Nigeria's economic problems and solutions:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/d697b55d62e98bfe.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>OECD slightly raises world GDP growth forecast to 2.7%</span></p></a><h3>1.

The government is doing its best to improve communication infrastructure for economic growth.</p><p class=align-left>For example, Nigeria launched its communications satellite (NigComSat-1R) in 2011 and approved the 5G network in 2021. Companies are rolling out microwave and fiber-based <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">national backbone networks</a>, mobile network operators are installing submarine fiber cables, and telecommunications infrastructure companies (infracos) are spreading broadband countrywide, especially in rural areas.</p><p class=align-left>Nigeria faces significant challenges in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">communications sector</a> despite these commendable developments. For example, cyber crimes have increased, the country has inadequate technology experts to deliver quality services, and ICT software and hardware are expensive to buy and maintain.</p><p class=align-left>Electricity disruptions and criminals vandalizing installed ICT equipment make it hard for most people to stay online consistently. The internet and technology have automated many jobs. This could lead to poverty and unemployment for many.</p><h4>Possible solutions for communication problems in Nigeria</h4><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/4496157278f2336d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fuel subsidy: Businesses suffer as transportation and food costs skyrocket in Nigeria</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Below are some ways Nigeria can solve some of the issues in the communications sector:</p><ul><li>The government and organizations should retain as many workers as possible even after ICT automates their services.</li><li>The government should stabilize the power supply, especially electricity, for people to use ICT infrastructure.</li><li>The government should provide more security for ICT infrastructure to reduce vandalism.</li><li>The government should prosecute ICT fraudsters to curb cyber crimes.</li></ul><h3>4. State-society gap</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/a77547d04ef732da.jpeg><p class=align-left>The state-society gap is one of the biggest problems of economic development in Nigeria. The government has drifted away from its citizens by concentrating on the wants and demands of foreign interests to secure financial support and investments.</p><p class=align-left>Foreign interests encourage the government to make minimal input into building institutions, policies, and strategies that can increase domestic taxation and other forms of revenue. As a result, the country relies heavily on funds from foreign entities to function.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/fb52e00be616e36e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Saudi-Russian discord clouds OPEC+ talks</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The West (and China) helps perpetuate this<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> state-society gap </a>by providing international aid or Official Development Assistance. Development consultants that accompany aid money also have an external orientation. They focus on the desires and wants of the foreign entities from which they came.</p><p class=align-left>These consultants influence or advise the government to focus on foreign priorities instead of its people's desires and wants. Consequently, this widens the gap between the government and its people.</p><h4>Possible solutions for the state-society gap in Nigeria</h4><p class=align-left>Below are some of the steps the government can take to reduce the state-society gap:</p><ul><li>Nigeria's government should reduce foreign financial support and investments. Instead, the government should focus on building local institutions for the country's development.</li><li>The government of Nigeria should stop relying on advice from consultants whose focus on the desires and wants of the foreign entities from which they came. Let Nigeria create independent organizations that produce actionable solutions relevant to the people.</li><li>The government should decentralize governance to reduce the state-society gap. It should also encourage leaders in decentralized governments to promote frequent social feedback.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/e5277a8b6d55a1a8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>CBN gives reasons for 2-year post-no-debit on crypto funds from banks</span></p></a><h3>5. Corruption</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/3fe95f708c42c180.jpeg><p class=align-left>Corruption is among the greatest threats to Nigeria's development.

The country earns a considerable sum of money from these resources. For instance, Nigeria <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">made about $47 billion</a> from mineral fuels, oils, and distillation products in 2019. The amount was over 80% of the country's export value.</p><p class=align-left>The natural resources in Nigeria promote corruption and poverty instead of economic development—only a few pocket income from these resources, leaving millions impoverished.</p><p class=align-left>There are other forms of<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> corruption in Nigeria</a>. Nepotism and vote-buying have put corrupt leaders and workers in public offices. Hence, the standards of professionalism have deteriorated. Public officials solicit bribes, and citizens willingly initiate bribes in public and private offices. Citizens and officers who refuse and report bribes experience negative consequences.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/5a38ab9c7a3c4669.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>EU, US ready common code of conduct on artificial intelligence</span></p></a><h4>How can Nigerians deal with corruption?</h4><p class=align-left>Nigeria is still battling corruption even though it has over five commissions, bureaus, and tribunals assigned to investigate and prosecute corrupt practices. Here are some possible <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">anti-corruption solutions</a>:</p><ul><li>The government should allow anti-corruption commissions, bureaus, and tribunals to conduct fair investigations into corruption cases without political influence.</li><li>Corrupt leaders and citizens should be punished as per the law and taken away from their wealth obtained by questionable means.</li><li>Citizens and officers who refuse and <a href=#>report bribes</a> should be rewarded.</li><li>Promote transparency in public procurement processes and access to information to make government officials more accountable.</li></ul><h3>6.
