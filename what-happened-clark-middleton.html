Do we just imagine that Glen's still out there in Red's orbit and we just don't see him and we hide it? We made the choice to acknowledge his death on the show, and that's going to happen fairly soon in the season. It's super sad, and it will be for Red, as well," Jon told the outlet.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>John added, "It was incredibly sad and incredibly shocking, and the way we had written him into the show reminded us that there was something so special about him [...] Hopefully, the way we acknowledge his passing on the show has that same sweet, affectionate story to it."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Clark Middleton died of West Nile virus in October 2020.</h2><p>Clark passed away on Oct. 4, 2020, after contracting the West Nile virus, a mosquito-borne disease.

He was a splendid performer and a beautiful human being. I hope he's smiling from heaven, that big smile I saw so often," Bong Joon-ho, the director of Snowpiercer, wrote in a statement.&nbsp;</p><p>During his decades-long career, Clark appeared in cult-classic movies like Kill Bill: Volume 2, Sin City, and Birdman.
