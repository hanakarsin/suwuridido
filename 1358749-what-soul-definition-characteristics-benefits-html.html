And what does it mean to be an old soul? Here are all the details you need to know about having such a personality.</p><h2>What does old soul mean?</h2><p class=align-left>What is the definition old souls?</p><p class=align-left><strong>Old soul definition:</strong> An old soul is a person who feels much older than their age reflects. This feeling is often accompanied by the gift of empathy, high intelligence, intuition, and keen insight into the human condition</p><p class=align-left>Old souls often feel as though they do not "belong" in this world, or this period of time. Due to this, most of them long for a sense of true meaning, purpose, and inner fulfillment that money, power, and success cannot achieve. This longing is often described as the thirst to <i>"return home."</i></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/73bffc95a37314e9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best Uncle Iroh quotes from Avatar: The Last Airbender</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Some people even believe that the real old soul meaning is a person who has learned from past incarnations or lives. They acquired specific knowledge from their past lives and apply it to their present life, thus gaining more wisdom than the average person.</p><p class=align-left>A great example of an old soul would be Nikola Tesla, an inventor, electronic engineer, and genius. His being an old soul is seen in his spiritual gifts in seeing things outside of his lifetime.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/73bffc95a37314e9.jpg><h2>Old soul traits</h2><p class=align-left>Am I an old soul? If you have these character traits, then you are.</p><h3>1. You do not like to go out just for the sake of going out</h3><p class=align-left>Going out just because seems pointless to you. You would rather save your time and money and do something of quality.</p><h3>2. You feel connected to the past</h3><p class=align-left>There is a feeling of special connection with those that are older than you. You cherish the information, knowledge, and skills you have learned from them over the years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/85fb4c270eea74db.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is soul searching?

You do not waste time asking why</h3><p class=align-left>After you have thought things through, you move ahead, confident in the knowledge that you have done all you needed to do to get going.</p><h3>6. You love meeting new people</h3><p class=align-left>Talking to people is enriching and adds to your experience of the world.</p><h3>7. You have a preference for solitude</h3><p class=align-left>Because old souls are disinterested in the pursuits and interests of the people in their age groups, they find it dissatisfying to make friends with people they find hard to relate to.</p><h3>8. You did not have a lot of friends as a kid</h3><p class=align-left>If you always felt like you were the odd-one-out when you were in school, it could be that you were more mature than the rest of the kids.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8b37be6315886b0a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Twin souls (flames): Discover the best definition, symptoms, and stages</span></p></a><h3>9.

You are the epitome of calm</h3><p class=align-left>You have learned that nothing gets done if everyone is running around losing their heads; someone needs to be the calm force.</p><h3>11. You have undergone an existential crisis</h3><p class=align-left>An existential crisis happens when a person starts to see through the lies and delusions within society. Since old souls ask deep and penetrating questions about life in their search for love, truth, and freedom, they may wonder what life is about, whether they have a true purpose, and start to think about the human condition more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/85fb4c270eea74db.jpeg><h3>12.
