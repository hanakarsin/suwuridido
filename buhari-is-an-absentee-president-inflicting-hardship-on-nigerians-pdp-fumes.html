The PDP in a statement on Sunday by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba held that the President and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have failed Nigerians but remain arrogantly unconcerned about it.
Ologunagba added in the statement that President Buhari has not only failed, but also abdicated his responsibilities and the frustration in the country can trigger another round of protests worse than the recent #EndSARS protests if the situation is not addressed immediately."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The frustration in the country is already degenerating into a nationwide restiveness that may result to the breakdown of Law and Order if allowed to fester.</p><p>“With petrol now selling between N400 to N500 per liter, diesel at over N800 per liter, kerosine at over N750 and aviation fuel at N670 per liter, millions of businesses, employments and sources of livelihood have collapsed in both urban and rural areas resulting in acute hardship and widespread social tension across the country.</p><p>“Our Party fears that the situation is getting to a boiling point and can trigger a nationwide agitation that might be worse than the October 2020 EndSARS if not addressed immediately.</p><p>“President Buhari must take responsibility for the criminal racketeering in his government by APC leaders which has led to the crippling of the economy under his watch. He should stop abdicating his duties by sending his aides to issue wild claims, fake promises and noncommittal apologies on the abysmal failures of his administration.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5FpZputmJa%2FqnnIrGSapl2Wr7Sxza2cnmWgp7K0tcOepa1lmaOzrbXCraCnn12drrOw0qGgqWWfo3qvtcaeqaKZnqh6sbDPZp2upZWofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
