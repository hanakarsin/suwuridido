Medical Doctors, Nurses and other health personnel will act as our agents in their polling units, “</p><p>“We are ahead of the people who are planning to rig the election at the polling units level. The current electoral act has made our votes secured and stop rigging at the polling unit through the electronic transmission of election results.</p><p>“Send the list of Doctors and nurses at the polling units since they can’t be compromised at the polling. They will serve as our agents. If the medical people are there, our votes will count.”</p><p>Abure went on to state that he was convinced the LP would attain victory in the upcoming election adding that when they eventually unveil their plans for the election other parties would be stunned and make way for them.</p><p>Responding to Abure, the leader of Docs&Medics4PeterObi, Dr Uche Uzoukwu said their association which is in all the polling units&nbsp; would influence 100,000 Nigeria Health practitioners to mobilize more than 30 million citizens to support the LP.</p><p>“We are now into town hall meetings and medical outreaches. We call the people for medical outreaches and after treating them, we tell the people the labour party logo and encourage them to collect their PVCs and vote,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e49vZmtoYmh6uLGMsKClpF2irqyxjK6qnmWfm3qlu8KtpqurXZa7pXnNrqmsnaNirrR5wKCcp6yjYsGwedKtpqllop60qLXNoGSlmZKkwrN5z5qprbFf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
