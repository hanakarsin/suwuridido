Though the Bachelorette has not found success in the love department (yet!), professionally, she’s on fire. So, what is Hannah Brown’s occupation?&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Hannah Brown does more than pageants for a living.&nbsp;</h2><p>Before being crowned Season 15’s Bachelorette, Hannah wore a different title. This 24-year-old was Miss Alabama 2018. During her reign, she used her platform to support mental health awareness and traveled around the state giving speeches, attending fundraisers, etc.</p><p>Aside from being a former pageant title holder, Hannah currently works as an interior decorator at Gracefully Done. According to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Linkedin</u></a>, profile, Hannah "combined my knowledge in communication within my passion with design and pursued a career in interior design at Gracefully Done in Northport, Alabama."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Miss America</span></figure><p>Adding, “It quickly became clear that this job was not just a hobby, and after graduation I decided to continue my work study under the designers at Gracefully Done. Soon, I was rewarded my own clients and promoted to interior designer in my own accord. My favorite part of designing and decorating is forming relationships with my clients and being able to meet specific needs for creating their dream space.”&nbsp;</p><p>The southern belle's profile also reveals that she works as a freelance makeup artist and hairstylist. In case you forgot, Hannah graduated from the University of Alabama with a Bachelors of Arts degree in Communications.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who does Hannah pick on The Bachelorette? (Warning: spoilers ahead)</h2><p>According to Reality Steve, Hannah has found her prince. It has been revealed that the <a href=#><u>final four guys</u></a> — Luke Parker, Jed Wyatt, <a href=#>Tyler Cameron</a>, and Peter Weber – were granted overnight dates with the blonde beauty.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>However, is looks like<a href=#> Luke P. slut-shames Hannah</a> ahead of their Fantasy Suite dates, prompting her to send him home, followed shortly by the elimination of our <a href=#>favorite pilot, Peter.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Hannah is then left with Tyler and Jed to choose from —and RS has reported that the lucky guy is Jed! The musician and Hannah are allegedly engaged, and she seemingly hinted at her engagement when talking to Ryan Seacrest about her time on the hit ABC show.&nbsp;</p><p>“I thought there was no way it was going to be me," she said. "I was a very polarizing figure... so it was a shock but I feel like because it did line up, it was supposed to be so it was all worth it."</p><p>Catch new episodes of The Bachelorette Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on ABC. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfna6vusChZJuqn6y7brvCnKypmaSevK8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
