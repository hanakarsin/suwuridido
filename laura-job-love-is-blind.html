This fresh season brings forth a batch of brand-new couples to cheer on, including <a href=#>Jeramey Lutinski and Laura Dadisman</a>, whose journey on the show so far has been nothing short of tumultuous.</p><p>We're sure many of you have already devoured all six episodes currently streaming on <a href=#>Netflix</a>, so you're well aware of the ups and downs of their relationship. With that in mind, let's shift gears and delve into Laura's background. So, who is she? What does Laura do for a living?

According to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn profile</a>, she landed her current role as an account director at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MWC Las Vegas</a> ‚Äî "the premier mobile ecosystem convention in North America" ‚Äî in October 2023.</p><p>Prior to this role, Laura amassed experience in various positions at OneStream Software, AmericasMart Atlanta, and Express LLC. For those curious about her educational background, Laura graduated from East Carolina University with bachelor's degrees in apparel merchandising and business management.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Laura faces backlash for her divisive remarks in Season 6 of 'Love Is Blind.'</h2><p>At first, most Love Is Blind viewers tolerate Laura ‚Äî but their tolerance quickly wanes as she engages in some rather controversial behavior. It all begins when the account director intervenes in the love triangle between <a href=#>Jimmy Presnell</a>, <a href=#>Chelsea Blackwell</a>, and <a href=#>Jessica Vestal</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Mackenzie and Laura comfort Jess during Season 6 of 'Love Is Blind.'</p></figure><p>Upon discovering that Jimmy has professed his love to Chelsea, Laura takes it upon herself to confront Jess and urges her to leave voluntarily. When Jess seeks an explanation, Laura cryptically insists that she's acting in her best interest and advises her to trust her judgment. Jess is left in tears, still in the dark about the real reason behind Laura's actions, though it appears she may have pieced it together herself.</p><p>Despite Laura's intentions, her actions draw ire from fans on social media, who criticize her handling of the situation.</p><p>"Now why the F--K would Laura tell Jessica she should leave simply off the strength of 'just trust me,'" one person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> on X (formerly known as Twitter). "Like, nah, b---h, you was messy enough to come [and] warn me, be messy enough to tell the whole truth."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Laura why not just tell Jess what Chelsea said? <a href=#>#LoveIsBlind</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4RtPcalH3v</a></p>‚Äî ReeCeMoniqueüë©üèΩ‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è ‚úçüèΩ‚ôåÔ∏è ‚úäüèΩ (@ReeCeMonique03) <a href=#>February 14, 2024</a></figure><p>Another fan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>, "I do respect Laura for coming to her, but she should have fully told her why not just left it like that to assume even worse."

AD attempts to tactfully explain to Laura that her suggestion doesn't come across as a joke, but Laura directs her frustration toward Jeramey for publicly embarrassing her instead.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>How is it okay to touch AD without her permission and Laura told her man to smack AD‚Äôs breast!?

In what world is it okay for Laura to even joke about her man touching AD's boobs?? DIRECTLY to her man?? And for her man to BRING IT UP TO AD AND LAUGH?"</p><p>"I wanna fight Laura because how dumb are you to tell Jeramey to slap AD's titty??? What part about that is funny??" another fan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commented</a>. "Also, you see how that man threw you under the bus?
