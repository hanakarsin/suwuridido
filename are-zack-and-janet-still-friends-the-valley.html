Are they still friends, or has a rift emerged? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Casey Durkin/Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">So, are Zack and Janet from 'The Valley' still friends?</h2><p>At the time of writing, Zack and Janet don’t appear to be friends anymore. A quick scroll on social media suggests they might have gone their separate ways, as they don't follow each other on Instagram.</p><p>Zack also frequently shares photos with Kristen Doute on Instagram, who just so happens to be Janet's "enemy." Thus, Zack's tight-knit bond with the former <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a> cast member strongly implies that he and Janet are no longer on good terms.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Janet explains why Zack was not invited to her Babymoon. According to her, they had fallen out and not spoken for two years prior to filming, and inviting him didn’t feel like a good fit <a href=#>#TheValley</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/BOQZoGVBiu</a></p>— Fancy Drew | Bravo Archive (@The_Lowerlevel) <a href=#>May 10, 2024</a></figure><p>Plus, on the May 10 episode of <a href=#>Scheana Shay</a>'s podcast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scheananigans</a>, Janet briefly opens up about where she and Zack currently stand and why she's "very happy" with her decision to exclude him from her babymoon.</p><p>"I had a gut feeling I will say, like, specifically about Zack. You know, we hadn't spoken for two years before my birthday … for a lot of reasons," Janet explained. "I had a gut [feeling] for not wanting to invite him on my babymoon, and I will say that after some recent events, I feel very happy that I made that choice."</p><p>Scheana chimed in, saying that Janet made the "best decision" she could have in a difficult situation. The host continued, "I think for Zack to sit there and be like, 'Janet and I are in a great place, why would I not be invited? Is it because I'm not in a couple? I'm being singled out.' Like no, bro, it's [because of] the things you've said and the things you've done over the past two years."</p><p>Janet further elaborated, "I didn't speak to him for two years … and then a couple weeks later, I'm choosing who I'm going to spend a weekend in a house with and not be able to escape, and I'm like, 'Who am I comfortable being under the same roof as for three days?' And he wasn't it. I had a gut feeling that I shouldn't invite him, and I feel very happy and vindicated with the choice I made."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Zack claims that Janet is "high-key a mean girl."</h2><p>Now, let's dive into that clip from the May 14 episode of The Valley. So, after learning from Jax Taylor that he's not invited to Janet and Jason's babymoon, Zack struggles to hold back tears at Kristen Doute's clothing line event. The girls attempt to comfort Zack, but he tells them this "really hurts" because he thought he and Janet "were in a good place."</p><p>"I have literally defended Janet 1,000 times over," Zack exclaims in front of everyone.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>In a confessional, Nia Booko tells the cameras that Zack's reaction makes her "really sad" because she believes he is "collateral damage." She notes, "He's friends with Kristen, so is that why he's not getting invited?"</p><p>Although a few fellow cast members assure Zack that he and Janet are in a good place, he doesn't believe them. And, in his own confessional, he calls Janet a "mean girl."</p><p>"You want to talk about mean girl behavior? Janet is a high-key mean girl," he states. "Not just low — she's high, low, she's medium, she's every type of a mean girl there is. And she's good at hiding it, which is the craziest part."</p><p>Watch The Valley on Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
