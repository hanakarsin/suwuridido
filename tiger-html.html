The Tiger is truly incapable of being tamed and meets life with a thirst for independence. These qualities can make the Tiger a bit unpredictable at times, as they have little patience for conventional wisdom or concerns. Unlike other signs in the Chinese Zodiac, the Tiger is not scared to take risks in life and actually prefers danger and excitement to playing it safe. Those born under the Tiger sign are no stranger to emotional highs and lows because it is the drama that feeds the spirit of the Tiger. There may be times when the intensity of the Tiger manifests itself in periods of emotional despair. It is in these times when the sometimes loner Tiger needs the support of loved ones.</p><p>Socially, there is little the Tiger likes more than being the center of attention. With their impulsive ways and love of excitement, the Tiger is known to draw the admiration of many. However, the Tiger can be quite the polarizing figure, as they bring strong opinions, passion and charisma into every task and interaction. Interestingly enough, despite the Tiger's need to be seen, they often prefer to play the role of the loner at times. When the Tiger is free from the social burdens of other people's interests, they can truly explore every impulse on a whim.</p><p>Those born under the Tiger sign always have the protection of their family at the forefront of their minds. In this respect they can be quite fearless and intense, but the Tiger also has a very playful side as well. The family life of the Tiger is filled with laughter and joy, as they want little else, but to enjoy all that life has to offer with those they love.</p><p>The passionate and adventurous Tiger needs a career that satisfies their dynamic needs. Although capable of compassion, the Tiger is not always the best leader, as their hot-headed intensity may overpower reason. Instead, the Tiger should pursue careers where their passion and strong ego are featured, such as advertising, business sales and sports. The Tiger would also do well in a position that allowed for travel or performance plays a role.</p><p>The Tiger's fixed element is the Wood Element. As Wood is associated with spring, the Tiger's personality is full of energy. Similarly, it is the the vitality of the Wood Element that sends the Tiger on a life-long quest for new experiences. It is this adventurous personality that can leave the Tiger feeling exhausted and emotionally drained at times. With practice, the Tiger can achieve a more balanced life to counteract his perpetual search for excitement. The Tiger's fixed organs are the liver and gall bladder. Those born under the Tiger sign are encouraged to avoid harming their vital organ with excess alcohol and unhealthy, rich foods.</p><p>The Tiger's two natural pairs are the Horse and the Dog. With a shared interest in adventure and excitement, the Tiger and the Horse have the potential to live an event-filled, fun-loving life. On the other hand, it is the mutual comfortability and respect shared between the Tiger and the Dog create an effective bond. The Tiger pairs most poorly with the ultra-competitive Monkey, as the two have little in common.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p63MqKysmpmnwamwwLKqZ5ufony7u8OimJxnpJ60pr6NoaumpA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
