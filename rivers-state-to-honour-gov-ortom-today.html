He has abandoned governance which is the reason everything is in total decay. He is a disaster to Benue State, he has become an errand boy or may I call him deputy to Wike or an aide to Wike; that is the reason you always see him going around with Wike.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze49sZquhppq%2FtHnSrZitnV2pvG60zqemrqpdnLy3ec6rq6ilXam8pa3YaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
