"But at the same time, there is so much to celebrate. I consider myself one of the most fortunate people on Earth. I was given a special talent to play tennis, and I did it at a level that I never imagined, for much longer than I ever thought possible."</p><p>"The last 24 years on tour have been an incredible adventure. When it sometimes feels like it went by in 24 hours, it has also been so deep and magical that it seems as if I've already lived a full lifetime. I have had the immense fortune to play in front of you in over 40 different countries. I have laughed and cried, felt joy and pain, and most of all, I have felt incredibly alive."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The game will miss these two ❤️<a href=#>@serenawilliams</a> | <a href=#>@rogerfederer</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/G630i4BlSL</a></p>— ESPN (@espn) <a href=#>September 15, 2022</a></figure><p>Roger thanked many in his retirement announcement, including his competitors on the tennis court: "I was lucky enough to play so many epic matches that I will never forget. ...
