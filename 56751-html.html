She has reached out to almost all those who matter in the party to support Umar but we will not bow to this because it is high time Her Excellency was counselled to be circumspect in the affairs of the PDP.”</p><p>However, the final decision on who takes over from Tukur would rest on the National Executive Committee (NEC) which meets today.</p><p>Prince Uche Secondus, the deputy national chairman,&nbsp; would take over the leadership of the party in acting capacity, if the option to immediately pick Tukur’s replacement from his zone fails.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgneDlGploaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
