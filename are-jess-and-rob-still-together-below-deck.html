She "wanted to figure that out," she recalls, and adds that her fling with Rob was her first-ever boatmance, as well as probably the last time she ever gets involved with another member of her crew.</p><p>"I've always been very anti-crew relationships," she says, teasing that viewers will get to see "a few, you know, some hiccups" between herself and Rob as the rest of the season unfolds.</p><p>On Aug. 24's episode, we watched as the whole crew scrambled to set up a scavenger hunt â€” complete with rhymes courtesy of Bugsy (can we talk about how much better the whole crew is getting along as a whole now that Hannah's off the boat?) â€” for Rob to surprise Jess after buying a ticket on her flight to Bali.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Rob has something to confess to Jess in tonightâ€™s episode...take a sneak peek here!ðŸ‘€ #BelowDeckMed</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Below Deck Mediterranean</a> (@belowdeckmedbravo) on Aug 3, 2020 at 12:37pm PDT</p></figure><p>The surprise itself turns out to be a bit anticlimactic, but so is this next bit: Jess and Rob are no longer an item and don't even talk or follow each other on Instagram anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>It seems like the flames fizzled after these two stepped off The Wellington.&nbsp;</p><p>"He has a really good heart, you know, deep down in there somewhere," Jess told InTouch now that filming is over. "I wish him the best of luck but I don't think we'll really be communicating," she added.&nbsp;</p><p>Asked whether there was anyone special in her life these days, Jessica confessed she is "very single" and that dating in the age of COVID-19 is seriously bleak, even if you're on all the apps.</p><p>"There's like a million people I'm talking to, but then you get bored, you can't meet anyone," she says from the yacht where she's currently working.</p><p>It's unclear what caused the breakup between "Job," but we can't help but wonder whether it has something to do with that woman Rob was casually dating earlier in the season.&nbsp;</p><p>New episodes of Below Deck Med air Mondays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2BmecmeqqxlkaOxbr7Om2SsrJmhuW7AzqCcraCVp3qjscuormaclZi4</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
