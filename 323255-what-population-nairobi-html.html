The population of Nairobi County is a true reflection of the rural-urban migration challenge that keeps coming up every decade. So how many people live in Nairobi? Well, the figure, according to KNBS, is 4,397,073 people. Apart from it being the most populated city in Kenya, it is also the most populous county in the country.</p><p class=align-left>The results mean that the population of the country has grown by more than four times since independence. The population as of 1969 was 10.9 million people but has increased to 47.6 million people. Similarly, Nairobi’s population has risen significantly since the first post-independence-Kenya. In 1969, the city’s population was pegged at 509,286 people against the 4.4 million people.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9c10f67496d8b60d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Somalia struggles in managing COVID-19 deepen as medics heap blame on health ministry</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The number of people has also increased from 3,138,369 people in the 2009 census to 4.4 million in 2019, a rise of one million people. Comparing the years from 1969 to date, and in the past decade, there has been a positive trajectory in the population data.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>List of richest countries in Africa</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b04c8ad49f710522.jpeg><h2>Nairobi population density</h2><p class=align-left>To calculate a population density, you take the total population and divide it by the available area. The resultant figure will determine how many people live per one square kilometre. One significant aspect in this year’s census results was the population distribution across the country and in specific areas</p><p class=align-left>The “green city under the sun” is consistently growing. In total, the size of Nairobi is 696 kilometres squared. On the other hand, the number of residents living in the city is about 4.4 million people. After calculating the population density, it brings us to approximately 6,000 people per square kilometre.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ee7df31e6a74d62e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The top 10 biggest houses in the world in 2021 (and the owners)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Compared to any other county in Kenya, Nairobi has the most ethnically diverse residents. All the tribes recognized in the constitution as part of the Kenyan population reside here. Furthermore, those who live in the city are either working there or doing business. It means the county brings together the largest working population in the country. It also boasts as the highest revenue collecting county in the country, thanks to its large number of multinationals from Africa.</p><p class=align-left>Several organizations both in Africa and across the world, have their headquarters in Kenya’s capital city. Also, some of the county’s most productive and most profitable companies such as Safaricom have their headquarters here. Other well-performing companies situated in Nairobi include KenGen, Kenya Airways, and Kenya Commercial Bank.</p><p class=align-left>Nairobi has not been left behind both in infrastructure development and economically. While the population surge is expected to strain the available resources and result in a state of unrest as witnessed in other developing countries, Nairobi through its administrative authorities has found a way to deal with the issue. For instance, the county has made attempts to reduce the number of motor vehicles entering the central business district on various occasions. It has also initiated measures to use technology in all its payment services, including parking fees and business permits.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/535a722f89f613cc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Opinion: African countries must support the actions of CAR’s legitimately elected President Touadera</span></p></a><h2>Nairobi demographics</h2><p class=align-left>Since its foundation, Nairobi has experienced steady growth in the number of people. The 4.1% growth in population makes it one of the highest growing cities in Africa. It is also the second-largest city in the African Great Lakes even though it is among the youngest cities in the region.</p><p class=align-left>However, there is a disadvantage to this growth. Given the rate of growth contributed by increasing rural-to-urban migration and high birth rates, the city’s economy is yet to catch up. For instance, a more significant population of youth in Nairobi is unemployed despite having the necessary qualifications. It is estimated that about 40% of all the residents living in the city cannot afford proper shelter and other basic needs.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>10 poorest countries in Africa</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9c10f67496d8b60d.jpeg><h2>Political administrations and divisions</h2><p class=align-left>Nairobi county is run by a governor, one senator, a woman representative, members of the county assembly, and members of parliament.

Due to the tight population density, Nairobi has one of the largest county assemblies in the country. Other than the high-end neighbourhoods, most of these wards have a bordering low-class population forming slums.</p><p class=align-left>The census is reflective of the country’s current status in terms of the number of people, their density and distribution. Following its release by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, the president announced that the results were pivotal in planning and dividing the national cake. But more outspoken in this year’s data is the population of Nairobi which has grown by more than one million people over the past decade. The county also leads in the population density and number of unemployed youth. However, there are challenges with the availability of resources to cater for the increasing number of residents.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Richest county in Kenya - Top 10 richest counties</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FkWxpbm1drLWiwIyppqmtnJbBqrvNZqWaoaKkr6p6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
