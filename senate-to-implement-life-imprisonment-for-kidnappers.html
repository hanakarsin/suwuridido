No, most victims are often poor villagers, sometimes kidnapped indiscriminately, a departure from the targeted kidnapping of wealthy people. They struggle to pay ransoms because of their relative poverty; and this has resulted into many victims being killed in the process.</p><p>“Nigeria has one of the rates of kidnaps for ransom of both locals and foreigners in all of Africa.</p><p>“While the insurgents in the North East now thrive on the proceeds of kidnappings, criminal elements in the South East and South West are also having a field day. In fact, kidnapping has now become a big and lucrative business.</p><p>“This bill also provides more punitive measures for ancillary crimes flowing from the commission of the crime of abduction, like death or grievous harm.</p><p>“To achieve the deterrent effect, life imprisonment is proposed for the offence of kidnapping, particularly where death results from the act.</p><p>“The law is made stricter by ensuring that recipients of any proceeds of the act of kidnapping are heavily sanctioned with a term of imprisonment of up to 30 years”</p><p>The Senate President, Ahmed Lawan,&nbsp;referred the bill to the committee on Judiciary, Human Rights, and Legal Matters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5FrZqydnpbBpnnTqGSipaChsq6xza1kpaGWmnqquc%2BroKynnqKyr8CMn6arZZuesa%2Btz6mcq6tf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
