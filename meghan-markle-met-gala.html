She was invited to attend the star-studded event with British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful, whom she worked closely with when she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">guest-edited the British Vogue "Forces for Change" issue</a>.</p><p>Sources said that Meghan is on the guest list and the team is excited she's attending the event. Fans are expecting to see a “glamorous androgynous” look.&nbsp;</p><p>It will be one of her first major non-royal appearances. Meghan will reportedly attend the big bash without her husband so "she can establish herself once more in Hollywood." Currently, Meghan and Prince Harry are splitting their time between the U.K. and the United States.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>“After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution. We intend to step back as ‘senior’ members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen. It is with your encouragement, particularly over the last few years, that we feel prepared to make this adjustment. We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America, continuing to honour our duty to The Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages. This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity. We look forward to sharing the full details of this exciting next step in due course, as we continue to collaborate with Her Majesty The Queen, The Prince of Wales, The Duke of Cambridge and all relevant parties. Until then, please accept our deepest thanks for your continued support.” - The Duke and Duchess of Sussex For more information, please visit sussexroyal.com (link in bio) Image © PA</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex</a> (@sussexroyal) on Jan 8, 2020 at 10:33am PST</p><span>Source: Sussex Royal/Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Meghan and Harry turned down an invitation to the Oscars.</h2><p>Reportedly, Harry and Meghan were both invited to be presenters at the 2020 Oscars.
