I know I have tried my best to fix things but I believe it is beyond repair now. 3 months ago and at Funkes insistence I moved out of the house and apart from AMVCA have not been able to get Funke to sit down in an amicable manner to discuss the future of our relationship. I’m making this announcement so that the public is clear that we both are pursuing separate lives. We still have issues that need to be addressed such as the custody and wellbeing of our children which is paramount as well as business interests which need to be disentangled but I have no doubt that these will be resolved one way or the other.”</p><p>An hour after the post was made Alichi took to her Insta Stories to pray for her marriage.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/62bd835089e5b.jpeg alt width=649 height=1024 sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5JpZp%2BtnqCybq3KoqWdnZyawG6vzqWjnpmXqrJur8eisbOxXZa5qq%2FHomSbnZeeu7R5z6uYsp2iqHqistOeqWaZnqO8trrCnqSepqRivKd5wJyrq52jqMBur9GaqqGdlGK6or7RopignV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
