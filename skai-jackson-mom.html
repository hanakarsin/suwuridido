Former Disney Channel star Skai Jackson is hoping to take home the Mirror Ball trophy on Season 28 of Dancing With the Stars. After already impressing the judges with her tango during Week 1, the 18-year-old will most likely make it far in the competition. 
One person who is definitely rooting for Skai is the actress's mom, Kiya Cole."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Yes, it’s her job, but for the most part, just to have fun with it, because you have to love what you do," she told the outlet. "Also, I try to keep her as grounded as possible, which I’m pretty good at," adding, "I try to keep her humble."</p><p>Prior to managing her daughter's successful career, Kiya was working at the post office in New York. After a few people complimented how "cute" her daughter was, she sent pictures to modeling agencies. "At the time, the only thing I could think of is, ‘Well, hopefully she can make enough money to go to college,'" she told Refinery29.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Since starting her career, Skai went on to book her breakout gig in the Disney Channel series Jessie.

Though she didn't address Skai by name, fans suspected the post was directed at the actress.&nbsp;</p><p>After Skai addressed their beef and posted that the two were "cool," Danielle ranted about the DWTS contestant on a livestream.&nbsp;</p><p>"Why are you so obsessed with me, b---h? I will literally kill you. I don’t know why you’re not understanding that. You’re so small, if I get my hands on you… it’s over, you’re going to the hospital," she said.</p><p>Following the continued social media rant, Skai's mom Kiya and Danielle's mom Barbara Ann Bregoli got involved.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The two traded insults, which ultimately resulted in nothing getting resolved. Afterward, Skai filed a restraining order against the teen, which the actress was granted. Danielle was issued to stay 100 yards away from Skai, her home, and her place of work. The rapper also cannot contact the young actress.</p><p>"Y’all can play around on your finstas but I’ll always say what’s on my mind as cuz that’s who I am. Go get your restraining order , Imma go get checks," Danielle posted in a lengthy Instagram statement on Feb. 27.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, it seems like the feud has been squashed.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLiitYyjmJyjo6S7brnOpg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
