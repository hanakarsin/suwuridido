These names often originate from Native American sources, and that's where the name Cold Moon comes from as well.</p><p>Cold Moon comes originally from the Mohawk tribe, and it was given that name because it coincides with the more frigid weather that December brings.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does the Cold Moon mean for your Zodiac sign?</h2><p>Astrologist and co-founder of <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">Zenchronicity</a>, Megan Michelena, spoke to Distractify exclusively about what the Cold Moon means for each zodiac sign ‚Äì and how it affects each one differently.</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Aries</strong> ‚Äî&nbsp;Watch your temper with this full cold moon coinciding with mars retrograde. Your energy feels off, which can lead to you popping off without reason. Ares, it‚Äôs a time to go within, take a genital yoga class, get a pedicure, and relax. It‚Äôs not the time to be engaging too much with others.</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Taurus</strong> ‚Äî&nbsp;You are feeling unstable in the world where you usually feel so grounded. It‚Äôs time to make a bowl of hot soup and breath. Come back to the world of the sense and take a few naps if needed. Also, not the time to make any major financial moves; we know it‚Äôs the holidays but save a few for a rainy day; you will be happy you did later!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>last full moon of 2022 is the cold moon in gemini üåï. walk in duality. call in manifestations. welcome change.</p>‚Äî hey, draughter (@heydraughter) <a href=#>December 7, 2022</a></figure><p style=text-align:start><strong>Gemini</strong> ‚Äî Can‚Äôt focus? You are used to being able to rely on your mind to guide you, but not right now! Drop into your body and take a breath from all that mental stimulation you love. It‚Äôs a great time to get a mediation practice or massage. Remembering the body has its own intelligence, and you forget that all too often.</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Cancer</strong> ‚Äî Feelings! Overwhelmed doesn‚Äôt even describe what is happening in your world right now. Don‚Äôt shut them out; time for a girl‚Äôs night with wine or a spa day! Talk it out, and don‚Äôt hold your feelings in. A lot is going on in that head of yours, and you will feel much better after you talk it out!</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Leo</strong>‚Äî&nbsp;This full cold moon will test you! Your friendships have been shifting, and more tests will come. Who are your people? Who do you trust? Keep your friends close and your enemy closer. Disagreement and fights will occur if you aren‚Äôt careful of your energy, but you will see people more clearly in the coming days, for better or worse.</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Virgo</strong> ‚Äî&nbsp;While you tend to have a way with words, be mindful of how you communicate during this lunation. The full cold moon can mess with how words are being received. Your matter-of-fact ways of sharing important details could be easily taken out of context. Beware of high emotions in others and only share what is necessary; it‚Äôs not the time to be nitpicky; it will only do harm.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>this full moon in gemini i HIGHLY recommend writing a burn letter. release every piece of bullshit, heartbreak, pain, loss, stress, financial insecurity, etc. that you experienced this year and release all of it out so you don‚Äôt take it into the new year. RELEASE THE BULLSHIIT!!</p>‚Äî ‚ù•blessed ess (@esssdabest) <a href=#>December 6, 2022</a></figure><p style=text-align:start><strong>Libra</strong> ‚Äî&nbsp;You find this time confusing as you usually are so balancing and understanding of others. Just know it isn‚Äôt you; it‚Äôs a weird time for most. Though you may not be getting the warm response you seek in others as a connector, just set back the tides are shifting soon!</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Scorpio</strong> ‚Äî&nbsp;How do you make boundaries? Now is the time to get clear. As your emotions shift and shake, recognize, respect, and tell others where you stand. Just because you are intuitive and more comfortable when it comes to others, it‚Äôs time to get clearer with your own! A hot bubble bath will help.</p><p><strong>Sagittarius</strong> ‚Äî You are so used to being the teacher at times, you forget that we are all students! Take this time to listen more than you speak; this feels unnatural to you. You have so much wisdom, but it‚Äôs time to gain more by listening to what your friends and the people around you have to say. You will be glad you did!</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Capricorn</strong> ‚Äî&nbsp;Produce, produce, produce‚Ä¶ that's your motto. But now is not the time for that. It will serve you to take time right now to be! I know that‚Äôs a hard thing to ask of you, but without balance, what is life anyways? Let‚Äôs learn some balance, Capricorns.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The <a href=#>#ColdMoon</a> rises on 7 Dec EST, 23:08, & 8 Dec GMT, 04:08.
