At the time, she had been a full-time member of the troupe since 2016 and told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> that she didn't "know when it's going to happen, but I have my fingers crossed that it's going to happen very soon."</p><p>"I'm still the newest girl," she added back then, but she wasn't invited to take part in last year's Season 28.&nbsp;</p><p>The season marked "the first time since Season 11" without a dance troupe, which meant the unfortunate absence of beloved stars like Britt Stewart and Hayley Erbert. Fans were upset that the show also went ahead and announced two new pros instead of promoting the fan favorites troupe members.</p><p>Britt graciously took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> to express her love for Dancing with the Stars, despite the fact that she was clearly disappointed not to be participating in the season. "It has truly been the most wonderful past three years and I am beyond grateful for my time at DWTS," she said. "If I were to go back and ask the little Black girl who aspired only to dance, she would have never even imagined changing out her tap shoes for Latin heels and being a part of such a significant TV show for dance."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span><p>Brandon Armstrong, Hayley Erbert, Britt Stewart and Alan Bersten of "Dancing with the Stars"</p></figure><p>"Dancing With the Stars came into my life as a very welcomed surprise," she continued her summer 2019 tribute. "It came at a time in my life when I was craving change and growth and it did not disappoint! It's forever changed me as a woman, an artist, and a dancer."</p><p>While she was "truly sad about not being part of this season," she was positive that "God/The Universe has a plan for me!" Boy, was this dancer right.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 29 will truly see Britt shine, as a 'DWTS' pro.</h2><p>After becoming a full-time member of the troupe in 2016 and sitting out last year's season, Britt was understandably overjoyed when she learned she had been promoted to pro. "It's happening!" she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET</a> hours after the news was announced on Tuesday, Aug. 18. "I'm just so grateful, so excited, and over the moon, honestly. Ever since I found out, I just don't really know what to do with myself. So much excitement, so much emotion."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>It‚Äôs actually happening!!!

"I started crying and then immediately when I got off the Zoom call [with producers] I called my mom and I was just like, 'Ahh!' and just all the tears were flowing."</p><p>"To be the first Black female pro is such an honor, and I definitely don't take it lightly," she said.
