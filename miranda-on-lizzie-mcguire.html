Adam Lamberg will play Gordo — who isn't Lizzie's boyfriend in this new, adult universe, sorry, everyone! — while Jake Thomas will return as Lizzie's endlessly annoying younger brother, Matt."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It's Lalaine, the actress who played <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miranda on Lizzie McGuire.&nbsp;</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Miranda might not appear on the new Lizzie McGuire series.&nbsp;</h2><p>Lalaine (or Lalaine Vergara-Paras) mysteriously disappeared from our screens shortly after the original Lizzie McGuire series wrapped up. Despite their dazzling on-screen chemistry... Lalaine and Hilary didn't get on in real life.&nbsp;Don't @ me.</p><p>According to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fan theory</a>, this is the reason why Miranda didn't feature in the 2003 The Lizzie McGuire Movie.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PopCulture</a> vouches, her no-show in the full feature movie had to do with the fact that Lalaine was too busy shooting another Disney movie, the relatively little-known Lalaine: I'm Not Your Girl.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">That's not the worst part about Lalaine's career.&nbsp;</h2><p>Lalaine was arrested for the possession of methamphetamine in 2007. She pleaded guilty but failed to appear at a crucial court hearing, which led the judges to issue a bench warrant for her arrest.&nbsp;</p><p>The bench warrant was eventually recalled, and the star was sent to a drug facility in Long Beach, Calif. After she completed her treatment, the charges were expunged.&nbsp;</p><p>After some initial attempts to stay afloat in the movie industry — most notably, she played the character named "Gossipy Girl" in the 2010 Easy A —Lalaine withdrew from the field altogether and chose to pursue a career as a musician instead. However, this ambition had gone bust after a few years as well. Although she was signed with WarnerBros for a while, the much-anticipated record was never released.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Where is Miranda from Lizzie McGuire now?&nbsp;</h2><p>"[Lalaine] has mostly stayed out of the spotlight since then, but says she is doing well," notes Christy Box in a 2017 article published by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ScreenRant.&nbsp;</a></p><p>As the journalist prompts, the drug possession charges put a stamp on the actress's career, which she managed to slowly maneuver her way out of.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, she has two projects lined up, a drama about the tragic life of a former spelling bee champion titled Definition Please and a short film about a lone man's quest to dismantle the centuries-old classist structures underpinning contemporary societies.&nbsp;</p><p>There's no mention of Lizzie McGuire on her IMDb page.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Lalaine did receive a text from Adam Lambert very recently.&nbsp;</h2><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Buzzfeed</a> notes, the actress did receive a message from her former co-star in the running up to the new season of Lizzie McGuire, which could potentially indicate that not all is lost.&nbsp;</p><p>Will we ever get the chance to find out what happened to Miranda after her trip to Mexico?
