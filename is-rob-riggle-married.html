But his career success isn't the only thing fans are curious about. Fans have been wondering who Rob's wife is and if the two are still together. Here's an update on Rob's love life and the new woman he's been spotted with.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Rob Riggle with his now ex-wife, Tiffany Riggle.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Rob Riggle's wife? Meet Tiffany Riggle</h2><p>Ironically, Rob's marriage happened just a few years before his career in comedy took off, although both took place in the early 2000s. He discussed meeting his wife, Tiffany, with the Kansas City Star in February 2013, noting their first meeting took place in his hometown when he was employed with the Marines.</p><p>He met his friend, her boyfriend, and her work colleague (Tiffany) for drinks. Rob <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said of the encounter,</a> "I was so impressed, then I got nervous and squirrely. But I got her laughing, and that’s all that mattered."</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Tiffany, who now works as an interior designer (or did), moved to New York to be with him (Rob was stationed in New York at the time to try his hand at a comedy career), and the couple had two children: Abigail and George. While Rob prefers not to post pictures of his children on social media, it's clear they are very important to him, and he has spoken at length about being a father many times.</p><p>As of Oct. 18, 2020, however, Rob's marriage was no more. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> reported that on Oct. 5, Tiffany cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for filing for divorce, and that the couple had been separated since May 2. She also requested joint custody of their children, who are now around the ages of 18 and 12.</p><p>While Rob's divorce started out amicable, things went south after he accused her of stealing $28,000 from his home and planting a hidden camera inside. Then, in 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">word of a lawsuit</a> began stirring online, sometime after the alleged incidents took place.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Rob Riggle is now dating professional golfer Kasia Kay.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kasia Kay (@kamk725)</a></p></figure><p>Although things didn't work out between Rob and Tiffany, he moved on with a pro golfer. Rob and Kasia Kay reportedly met during Season 2 (2020) of <a href=#>Holey Moley </a>when the golfer was a contestant on the show. The two ended up growing close and in 2022, news of them dating began circulating the internet. Based on the numerous photos Kasia has posted to her Instagram, it seems like they are very happy together!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kasia Kay (@kamk725)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Was Rob Riggle a police officer?</h2><p>According to the Kansas City Star, before he was a father or a married man, Rob decided he first wanted to be an FBI agent while at the University of Kansas. When he called to inquire about the job experience needed, he was told they were in need of "accountants or lawyers," neither of which appealed to Rob. When the recruiter mentioned they also needed Marine Corps agents, Rob decided that was his ticket in, and enrolled in an officer training program.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Rob Riggle (@robriggle)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In 1990, Rob passed his aptitude test and went off to officer candidate school, but eventually returned to complete his degree from KU. Two days after his college graduation, he stood in Marine dress blues and accepted his commission into the Marines as a second lieutenant. However, his story takes a sharp turn when he dropped out of flight school, eventually to pursue a career in comedy.</p><p>Rob spent 23 years of service in the Marine Corps Reserve in addition to a successful comedy career. He officially retired from the Marine Corps in 2013, and has been continuing to act in television and films with one of his latest projects being Krapopolis.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuvs6bZKuhl5y5pnnMmqmroZWZ</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
