While having a romantic partner to raise kids with might be a prerequisite for some, it's not the path everyone takes, which is why actress <a href=#>Kristin Davis</a> is an ideal host for the show. Though she has two kids, she chose to go it alone.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Kristin Davis married?</h2><p>In a word, no ‚Äî and she never has been. Very unlike her most recognized role, Charlotte York / MacDougal / Rosenblatt, Kristin didn't feel the need to have the perfect marriage before she had kids, or any marriage at all, for that matter. Though she has been involved in several romantic pairings throughout her public life, she either didn't desire marriage or didn't find the right person to take that leap.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>But while she was not called to married life, she felt very strongly that she was meant to be a mom. "I still felt like there was a child out there that I needed to find that was my child," she told Jada Pinkett Smith in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Table Talk interview</a>. "I can't explain it. It was a spiritual kind of thing," she said.</p><p>Kristin pursued adoption, and in 2011 she adopted her daughter, Gemma, who is now 9 years old. Gemma is black, and because Kristin is white, she felt a strong responsibility to not only educate herself on black culture and how to style black hair, but to make sure her daughter feels part of the black community by having role models and people in her life who resemble her.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Off to school with cute Ebbitt .

Momma is "an unknown age, having been rescued from the streets," while Sammy is 15. Both were initially fosters, but Kristin "failed" at fostering and ended up adopting both pups.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kristin Davis also dedicates herself to humanitarian work.</h2><p>With acting work, two kids, and two furbabies, Kristin's life already seems full enough ‚Äî marriage or not ‚Äî but she's also a tireless champion for many worthy causes. She is a global ambassador for Oxfam and has done fundraising and charity work for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and several animal welfare organizations.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>This is Jabulani, a gorgeous male elephant in his prime. But in 1997 this elephant was found stuck in the mud around a mine in SA. And tragically orphaned after his elephant family could not free him. Luckily he was found and cared for by the vet team at @hesc_endangeredspeciescentre and Lente Roode, who called Daphne Sheldrick at @dswt for advise on how to raise an orphaned elephant. Now he is a beautiful and sweet full grown bull with a flourishing elephant herd, comprised of other rescued elephants and their own off spring. He lives at @campjabulani , an incredible place to visit. And when i think of him, i can‚Äôt help but think of a part of Daphne‚Äôs legacy living on. And i am so grateful for all of the people who love and care for these magnificent creatures. I am so incredibly lucky to have found them. ‚ù§Ô∏è</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>iamkristindavis</a> (@iamkristindavis) on Jul 25, 2018 at 12:50pm PDT</p></figure><p>She has a special spot in her heart for elephants as a patron of the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, which rescues and rehabilitates orphaned elephants, rhinos, and giraffes, many of whom lost their parents due to poaching and habitat destruction. The organization encourages patrons to "adopt" these baby animals, so in a way, Kristin has adopted countless "kids" who live on wildlife refuges in Africa.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBut9Giqq2hnmKxosLIrGSmmaKntqaw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
