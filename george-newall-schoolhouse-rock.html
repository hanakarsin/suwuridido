Most of us know the more famous shorts from Schoolhouse Rock, which ran on ABC in the 1970s and ‘80s. Although the show predates many, tell us you haven’t heard the jingle “Conjunction Junction” or “I’m Just a Bill.”
Those famous songs originate from videos created in part by George Newall."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Some of us may struggle to answer that question — but for George, who worked for an ad agency called McCaffrey & McCall in the early 1970s, the response is clear. He helped build a legacy in learning for young kids by creating Schoolhouse Rock.</p><p>The idea was hatched when David McCall asked George, then the agency’s creative director, to help his young son learn multiplication by setting the <a href=#>math facts</a> to music, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>. Along with the help of songwriters Ben Tucker and Bob Dorough and illustrator Tom Yohe, Schoolhouse Rock was born, going on to win multiple Emmy Awards and educate generations of children.</p><p>All of the founding members of the ABC show previously passed away. George died on November 30, 2022 in New York at the age of 88, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>. So, what was his cause of death?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">George's wife shared his cause of death with fans, who recently celebrated the show's 50th anniversary.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>The last surviving co-creator of the animated shorts, that are remembered fondly by so many kids who grew up <a href=#>in the ‘80s,</a> passed away due to cardiopulmonary arrest, according to his wife, Lisa Maxwell. George leaves behind a stepson and three sisters in addition to legions of grateful fans, some of whom <a href=#>feel kinda old</a> upon learning that the show debuted 50 years ago in February of 2023.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Schoolhouse Rock is 50.

Filling the Special with a bunch of celebrities that Gen Xers have never heard of was a bad idea." More detractors also took to social media to virtually shake their heads about the 50th anniversary show.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>How did ABC just ruin our childhood memories?
