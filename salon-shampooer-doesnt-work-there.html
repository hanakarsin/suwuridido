A <a href=#>TikToker</a> named Kirsten (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@kir.a.lo</a>) found herself in a similar situation while visiting a hair salon, and she shared the "weird" story with other users on the app. And there were some who believed she narrowly avoided a potentially bad situation.</p><p>"So I just had maybe the weirdest experience of my entire life. I don't even really know where to begin," Kirsten began. "But, OK, so, I went to get my haircut, and I'm in the little waiting area, waiting for my stylist to be ready. And this girl comes up to me and she says, 'Your stylist is just finishing up, so I'm going to shampoo you.'"</p><p>"And I was like, 'OK great, sounds good.' Like that's a normal occurrence, right? So I go back to the little hair wash station with her and she's washing my hair. Everything seems normal, and then I start noticing, like, all the other people who work there are like looking over at us."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kir.a.lo href=#>@kir.a.lo</a><p>Can someone please explain what just happened? <a title=storytime href=#>#storytime</a> <a title=weird href=#>#weird</a> <a title=hair href=#>#hair</a> <a title=help href=#>#help</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - kirsten üçì" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - kirstenüçì</a></figure><p>The TikToker continued with her story: "[They were] sort of whispering ... and this one girl goes and grabs another and they're like talking amongst each other."</p><p>"And I'm like, something is up, like what is going on? So then I see one of the girls go and grab the manager. And she says something to the manager and the manager looks over and like gets this weird look on her face, and she comes walking over, to us."</p><p>Here's where things take a turn for the especially strange.</p><p>"And she says, 'Ma'am, what are you doing?' And at first I think she's talking to me and I'm like, what? And then I realize she's talking to the girl who's washing my hair. And the girl just says 'sorry,' immediately stops what she's doing, and runs out. And I'm like, what just happened?!"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @kir.a.lo</span></figure><p>What happened was that the woman who wanted to wash Kirsten's hair seems to have a fetish for shampooing strangers.</p><p>"Apparently that girl washing my hair didn't work for the salon. The salon has no idea who she is. They apologized profusely, which, I mean ... wasn't their fault I guess, but I'm so weirded out, like what just happened?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @kir.a.lo</span></figure><p>"I have no words. But anyway they got an actual employee to come and wash my hair and then I got my hair cut," the befuddled TikToker said at the end of the video.</p><p>Other users who heard her story seemed to feel equally weirded out by what transpired. One person wrote in the comments: "I can‚Äôt explain it but I would feel so violated."</p><p>Someone else thought that there may've been a practical explanation as to why this random woman was running her fingers through Kirsten's hair: "Maybe she had an appointment after you and wanted to speed up the process."</p><p>Another person remarked that the situation could've been a heck of a lot worse, like if the same thing had happened at a different kind of appointment entirely: "Imagine if this happened at a doctor's office."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @kir.a.lo</span></figure><p>Some users on the app just wanted to know if the person did a good enough job, or if the salon techs needed to fix her shampoo work: "So did they rewash your hair or were they satisfied with her work?"</p><p>And then there were folks who shared their own stories of impostors attempting to utilize false pretenses for some unsavory means, like this one person who said: "When I was 4 I fell out of a moving vehicle. My mom didn‚Äôt notice. I was taken to hospital and a woman I didn‚Äôt know claimed to be my mom there."</p><p>And another TikTok user made a good point about the experience, writing that while the actions of this random shampooer may seem innocuous, because it's such a wild thing for a person to do, having that kind of individual so close to your head and neck is pretty terrifying.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @kir.a.lo</span><p>"New fear unlocked," someone else commented too.</p></figure><p>"It doesn't SEEM like a scary story but ... only a crazy person would do something like that and your HEAD was in a crazy person's hands!"</p><p>What do you think was going on? Was someone just attempting to prove their worth to a salon and demonstrate that they could be good at a job? Or were they just attempting to get a tip without anyone else seeing?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqK6tu81mqqGZnaW8sLHRZpuonaOjwW7DzquiZqyYmr%2Bm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
