This norm, fuelled by cheaters, has become so prevalent that many relationships are born and buried without even leaving a trace, let alone taking them as ‘big deals.' This is inherently true, especially in the lives of our celebrities, where both partners often cheat. Sometimes, however, a partner may be so annoyed by the unfaithfulness of their other half that they may resort to unheralded ways of ‘calming’ themselves. An example of this was witnessed yesterday between Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/0fgjhs2kock05vf35g.jpeg><h2>Rob’s daring move</h2><p class=align-left>Yesterday, Rob Kardashian shocked his 9.4million Instagram followers by uploading nude photos of Blac Chyna, his ex-girlfriend. He also emphasized each picture with snapshots of himself complaining about her unwelcoming behaviors towards her children and Rob himself. He accused Chyna of having spent his money on weight-loss surgery, soon after giving birth to Dream, their daughter.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f8376142d98904ba.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Young Lady Who Responded to Her DM in 24 Minutes Marries Man Who Sent Message</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It wasn’t for long before this came to the attention of Instagram who resorted to suspending Rob Kardashian’s account. He had evidently gone overboard and forfeited Instagram's policy on video and photo posting. Nudity is allowed on Instagram only if it is a work of art with values, e.g., Sculpture. You also have absolutely no freedom of expressing yourself explicitly to everyone over self-loving goals, let alone use someone else or their property to do the same. Especially without their consent, as was the case of Rob Kardashian.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Lilian Muli Divorce Story, Marriage and New Man in Her Life</p><p class=align-left>Soon after the suspension of Rob’s Instagram account, he took to his Twitter account to continue his scathing wrath on Blac Chyna. He posted the explicit photos there as well which Twitter too didn’t seem to welcome, and soon deleted them after about half an hour of their dispatch. Rob proceeded with tweets about his allegations on Blac Chyna. Other than mentioning his disgust on Chyna's surgery, he explicitly claimed to own Chyna’s body since he has been funding her expensive lifestyle. He bragged of having bought her precious jewelry worth 250K.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/859e9f09fad580c3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Man Attributes His Improved Life to Birth of Visually Impaired Twins: "I Was Pushed to Work Hard"</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f8376142d98904ba.jpeg><p class=align-left>Rob also hinted to have never cheated on Chyna and that he loved her as his wife. He went on to expose how a cheater Chyna was on him by claiming that she gave all his robes to the men that she slept with, in his own house that he pays for himself. The fact that he was left soon after having a baby girl who is now a few months old was angered him so much. Rob considered the baby to be, “the best thing that’s happened to me,” he quoted. In addition to these, he also believed that Black Chyna's behavior might have been as a result of Kylie, his sister, dating Tyga who happens to be Chyna’s ex-boyfriend and her baby-daddy.</p><h2>Chyna’s resolve</h2><p class=align-left>Blac Chyna also took to her social media accounts to fire back at Rob. She accused him of having laid hands on her and annoyingly acted as if nothing did happen. Shortly after the fiery exchanges, however, Black Chyna Instagram activity seemed to have resumed to normal. This was even after Rob Kardashian had allegedly cut off his financial support to her and had also claimed back the 250K worth jewelry. Black Chyna latest news has it that she had to seek a restraining order to stop the fiery word exchanges with Rob.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/2712598d3124b45d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Two of My Muslim Friends Were My Bridesmaids: Christian Lady Says</span></p></a><h2>Kardashians’ reactions</h2><p class=align-left>Reportedly, Rob’s own family was deeply disappointed in his acts and very frustrated with him. Kris Jenner and company blamed him for making a difficult situation even worse. The family was also concerned about protecting the child from all that nastiness caused by the parents. His celebrity friends, the likes of TI, offered him free advice to refrain from childishly solving the matter but he turned a deaf ear to these.</p><p class=align-left>It is a behavior so unspeakable, but some may tend to understand Black Chyna and Rob, especially if they have been in this same position. Rob's cries of having taken care of his partner and having loved her as his wife, but still ended up being dumped, aren't news at all. This has happened in many modern relationships, especially in highly ‘civilized' societies. What differentiates the scenarios, however, are the resolves of the wronged. Another interesting news is that before meeting Rob, Blac Chyna had accumulated her own assets. They should ponder over their predicaments first before jumping into dehumanizing resolves.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2BlW9va3FdqbWmedSlq6Klkamybr7Er5ylmaSevK950aiZZqORp7Giv8eimKdlkqGupHnCobCnmV2XvLqy0aKcp5xencGuuA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
