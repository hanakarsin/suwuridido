Her husband's agency is the focus of the new reality realty show, so why isn't she a part of it?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>It goes without saying that <a href=#>Kyle Richards</a> has become one of the biggest faces in reality television over the last few years. Thanks to her work on <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a>, millions of fans have grown to adore her charm and mannerisms. During that time, fans have also become familiar with her husband, <a href=# style=text-align:start>Mauricio Umansky</a>, a real estate mogul who runs The Agency, a luxury firm in Beverly Hills, Calif. Now, his life is getting the spotlight in a new show titled <a href=#>Buying Beverly Hills</a>.</p><p>However, its worth noting that when Buying Beverly Hills premiered on <a href=#>Netflix</a> on Nov. 4, 2022, Kyle was nowhere to be seen. On top of that, she hasn't been included in any official listings of <a href=#>cast members</a> on the show either. So, what gives? Why isn't Kyle on Buying Beverly Hills? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why is Kyle Richards not on 'Buying Beverly Hills'?</h2><p>Aside from a momentary cameo in the form of a FaceTime call, Kyle will not appear at all on Buying Beverly Hills alongside Mauricio and their daughters, <a href=#>Farrah</a> and Alexia. Why? Well, Kyle simply doesn't have the time for it, as she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a> during an interview.</p><p>"I'm really excited for my husband and the girls," Kyle explained in July 2022 about her family's first joint foray into reality television. "It's exciting, it's fun to see how [The Agency] has grown. But I really have my hands full with the Housewives and my acting and producing again. My plate is full right now."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>On top of that, it's worth noting that Kyle is a part of the Bravo family, while Buying Beverly Hills is a Netflix-helmed production. Considering the fact that Kyle is under contract with the former network, it would likely have been difficult for her to take on a regular role on her husband's show. Nonetheless, the new program promises to be all that fans of Kyle and the Richards-Umansky family could ask for.</p><p>Be sure to check out Buying Beverly Hills, streaming now on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecispa1lm665pnnRopqhmaKZwG67zWaZrrGZo7RursSvnKukqWK1qrjLrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
